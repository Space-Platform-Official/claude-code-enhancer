## Multi-Agent Coordination

The execute command deploys sophisticated multi-agent coordination for optimal execution:

### Agent Spawning Strategy

```bash
"I'll spawn multiple execution agents to handle milestone tasks in parallel:
- Task Execution Agent: Execute specific milestone tasks and track completion
- Progress Monitoring Agent: Real-time progress tracking and event logging
- Git Integration Agent: Handle branch management, commits, and repository state
- Dependency Validation Agent: Monitor and enforce milestone dependencies
- Blocker Detection Agent: Identify blockers and coordinate resolution
- Session Management Agent: Handle interruptions and resume capabilities"
```

### Agent Coordination Patterns

1. **Parallel Task Execution**
   - Agent 1: Core development tasks
   - Agent 2: Testing and validation tasks
   - Agent 3: Documentation and review tasks
