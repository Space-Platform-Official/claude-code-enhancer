# üöÄüöÄüöÄ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: PRODUCTION-GRADE API DESIGN! üöÄüöÄüöÄ

**THIS IS NOT A PROTOTYPE - THIS IS A PRODUCTION API TASK!**

When you run `/api-design`, you are REQUIRED to:

1. **RESEARCH** existing API patterns and industry standards
2. **DESIGN** RESTful/GraphQL endpoints following best practices
3. **GENERATE** complete OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas
4. **CREATE** SDKs and comprehensive documentation
5. **USE MULTIPLE AGENTS** for parallel development:
   - Spawn one agent for API specification design
   - Spawn another for implementation
   - Spawn more agents for SDK generation and documentation
   - Say: "I'll spawn multiple agents to handle different API aspects in parallel"
6. **DO NOT STOP** until:
   - ‚úÖ API follows industry best practices
   - ‚úÖ Complete OpenAPI/GraphQL specifications
   - ‚úÖ Working implementation with validation
   - ‚úÖ SDKs for multiple languages
   - ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation

**FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS:**
- ‚ùå "Basic CRUD endpoints" ‚Üí NO! Design thoughtful, domain-driven APIs!
- ‚ùå "Simple REST API" ‚Üí NO! Consider GraphQL, versioning, and advanced patterns!
- ‚ùå "Documentation can come later" ‚Üí NO! Design-first approach required!
- ‚ùå Ad-hoc endpoint design ‚Üí NO! Consistent, well-planned API required!

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**
```
1. Research domain ‚Üí Understand requirements and patterns
2. IMMEDIATELY spawn agents for parallel design
3. Design specification ‚Üí Create comprehensive API contract
4. Implement endpoints ‚Üí Build production-ready implementation
5. Generate SDKs ‚Üí Create client libraries
6. REPEAT for any missing components
```

**YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL:**
- Complete API specification exists
- All endpoints implemented and tested
- SDKs generated for target languages
- Full documentation published
- API follows all best practices

üõë **MANDATORY PRE-DESIGN CHECK** üõë
1. Re-read ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md RIGHT NOW
2. Check current TODO.md status
3. Verify you understand the API requirements

Execute comprehensive API design with ZERO tolerance for shortcuts.

**FORBIDDEN EXCUSE PATTERNS:**
- "REST is simple enough" ‚Üí NO, consider all API paradigms
- "We can add features later" ‚Üí NO, design for extensibility now
- "Basic authentication will do" ‚Üí NO, consider security comprehensively
- "Internal API doesn't need docs" ‚Üí NO, all APIs need documentation
- "One endpoint per model is fine" ‚Üí NO, design around use cases

Let me ultrathink about designing a world-class API for this domain.

üö® **REMEMBER: APIs are contracts that live for years!** üö®

**Comprehensive API Design Protocol:**

**Step 0: Requirements Analysis**
$ARGUMENTS

- Understand the domain and business requirements
- Identify all actors and their needs
- Define success criteria and constraints
- Research existing solutions and standards

**Step 1: API Paradigm Selection**
Choose the most appropriate approach:
- **REST**: For resource-oriented operations
- **GraphQL**: For flexible data fetching
- **RPC**: For action-oriented operations
- **WebSockets**: For real-time communication
- **Event Streaming**: For event-driven architectures

**Step 2: Domain Modeling**
- [ ] Identify core domain entities
- [ ] Define relationships and boundaries
- [ ] Map business operations to API operations
- [ ] Consider aggregate roots and consistency boundaries
- [ ] Design for eventual consistency where needed

**Step 3: API Design Principles**
- [ ] RESTful resource naming (nouns, not verbs)
- [ ] Consistent HTTP method usage
- [ ] Proper status code selection
- [ ] Idempotency for appropriate operations
- [ ] HATEOAS for discoverability
- [ ] Resource versioning strategy
- [ ] Pagination and filtering patterns
- [ ] Bulk operations support

**For GraphQL APIs:**
- [ ] Schema-first design approach
- [ ] Proper type definitions and relationships
- [ ] Query complexity analysis and limits
- [ ] Efficient resolver implementation
- [ ] Subscription design for real-time features
- [ ] Schema evolution and deprecation

**Step 4: Security Design**
- [ ] Authentication mechanism (JWT, OAuth, API keys)
- [ ] Authorization model (RBAC, ABAC, custom)
- [ ] Rate limiting and throttling
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] CORS policy definition
- [ ] HTTPS enforcement
- [ ] API key management
- [ ] Audit logging requirements

**Step 5: Data Contract Design**
- [ ] Request/response schemas
- [ ] Error response formats
- [ ] Consistent field naming conventions
- [ ] Date/time format standardization
- [ ] Internationalization support
- [ ] Pagination metadata structure
- [ ] Filtering and sorting parameters

**Step 6: API Specification Creation**
Generate complete specifications:

**For REST APIs (OpenAPI 3.0+):**
- [ ] Complete OpenAPI specification
- [ ] All endpoints documented
- [ ] Request/response examples
- [ ] Error scenarios covered
- [ ] Security schemes defined
- [ ] Server and environment configs

**For GraphQL APIs:**
- [ ] Complete GraphQL schema
- [ ] Type definitions and resolvers
- [ ] Query/mutation documentation
- [ ] Subscription specifications
- [ ] Schema introspection enabled

**Step 7: Implementation Standards**
- [ ] Consistent error handling
- [ ] Proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Caching strategies
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] Connection pooling
- [ ] Graceful degradation

**For Go Implementation:**
- [ ] Clean architecture patterns
- [ ] Proper context propagation
- [ ] Structured error responses
- [ ] Middleware for cross-cutting concerns
- [ ] Proper JSON serialization
- [ ] Request validation
- [ ] Database transaction management

**Step 8: Testing Strategy**
- [ ] Unit tests for business logic
- [ ] Integration tests for endpoints
- [ ] Contract testing for API compliance
- [ ] Load testing for performance
- [ ] Security testing for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Mock server for client development

**Step 9: SDK Generation**
Create client libraries for:
- [ ] JavaScript/TypeScript
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Go
- [ ] Java
- [ ] C#/.NET
- [ ] Others as needed

SDK Requirements:
- [ ] Auto-generated from specifications
- [ ] Type-safe client interfaces
- [ ] Error handling patterns
- [ ] Authentication handling
- [ ] Retry mechanisms
- [ ] Documentation and examples

**Step 10: Documentation Strategy**
- [ ] API reference documentation
- [ ] Getting started guides
- [ ] Authentication guides
- [ ] Code examples in multiple languages
- [ ] Postman/Insomnia collections
- [ ] Interactive API explorer
- [ ] Migration guides for versions
- [ ] Rate limiting documentation

**Parallel Development Strategy:**
When implementing the API, spawn multiple agents:
1. **Specification Agent**: Create OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas
2. **Implementation Agent**: Build server-side endpoints
3. **SDK Agent**: Generate client libraries
4. **Documentation Agent**: Create comprehensive docs
5. **Testing Agent**: Implement all test categories

**API Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] All endpoints follow RESTful conventions
- [ ] Consistent error response format
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes used
- [ ] Authentication/authorization implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate

**Versioning Strategy:**
- [ ] Semantic versioning for breaking changes
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintenance
- [ ] Deprecation timeline planning
- [ ] Migration path documentation
- [ ] Version negotiation mechanism

**Monitoring and Observability:**
- [ ] Request/response logging
- [ ] Performance metrics collection
- [ ] Error rate monitoring
- [ ] Usage analytics
- [ ] Health check endpoints
- [ ] Distributed tracing support

**Final Verification:**
The API is ready when:
‚úì Complete specification generated
‚úì All endpoints implemented and tested
‚úì SDKs available for target languages
‚úì Comprehensive documentation published
‚úì Security measures implemented
‚úì Performance benchmarks met
‚úì Error handling comprehensive
‚úì Monitoring and logging configured

**Final Commitment:**
I will now execute EVERY API design step listed above and create a production-grade API. I will:
- ‚úÖ Research domain and requirements thoroughly
- ‚úÖ SPAWN MULTIPLE AGENTS for parallel development
- ‚úÖ Design comprehensive API specifications
- ‚úÖ Implement robust server endpoints
- ‚úÖ Generate client SDKs
- ‚úÖ Create complete documentation

I will NOT:
- ‚ùå Design basic CRUD APIs
- ‚ùå Skip security considerations
- ‚ùå Ignore performance requirements
- ‚ùå Create APIs without proper documentation
- ‚ùå Implement without comprehensive testing
- ‚ùå Stop at "minimum viable" APIs

**REMEMBER: This is a PRODUCTION API task, not a prototype!**

The API is complete ONLY when it meets all enterprise-grade requirements.

**Executing comprehensive API design and implementation NOW...**
