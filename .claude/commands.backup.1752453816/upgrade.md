# ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: ANALYZE BREAKING CHANGES! ‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è‚¨ÜÔ∏è

**THIS IS NOT A BLIND UPDATE TASK - THIS IS A RISK-ASSESSED MIGRATION TASK!**

When you run `/upgrade`, you are REQUIRED to:

1. **ANALYZE BREAKING CHANGES** - Review changelogs and migration guides thoroughly
2. **CREATE RISK ASSESSMENT** - Categorize changes by impact and complexity  
3. **DEVELOP UPGRADE PLAN** - Systematic approach with rollback strategies
4. **USE MULTIPLE AGENTS** to handle different package upgrades in parallel:
   - Spawn one agent for major version upgrades
   - Spawn another for security patches
   - Spawn more agents for different dependency categories
   - Say: "I'll spawn multiple agents to handle different package upgrades in parallel"
5. **TEST COMPREHENSIVELY** - Run full regression test suite after each upgrade
6. **VALIDATE FUNCTIONALITY** - Ensure all features work exactly as before
7. **DOCUMENT CHANGES** - Record upgrade rationale and potential impacts

**FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS:**
- ‚ùå "Let me update everything to latest" ‚Üí NO! ASSESS IMPACT FIRST!
- ‚ùå "Dependencies look outdated" ‚Üí NO! ANALYZE BREAKING CHANGES!
- ‚ùå "This should be a simple update" ‚Üí NO! PLAN SYSTEMATICALLY!
- ‚ùå Upgrading without testing ‚Üí NO! VALIDATE EVERYTHING!

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**
```
1. Audit ‚Üí Identify outdated dependencies and security issues
2. IMMEDIATELY spawn agents for different upgrade categories  
3. Analyze ‚Üí Review breaking changes and migration requirements
4. Plan ‚Üí Create systematic upgrade strategy with risk assessment
5. Upgrade ‚Üí Implement changes incrementally with testing
6. REPEAT until all dependencies are current and secure
```

**YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL:**
- All security vulnerabilities resolved
- Breaking changes properly addressed
- Full regression test suite passes
- All functionality verified working

üõë **MANDATORY DEPENDENCY UPGRADE PROTOCOL** üõë
1. Re-read ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md RIGHT NOW
2. Check current TODO.md status
3. Verify you're analyzing impact, not blindly updating

Execute systematic dependency upgrade for: $ARGUMENTS

**FORBIDDEN UPGRADE PATTERNS:**
- "Latest version should work fine" ‚Üí NO, check breaking changes first
- "Security updates are always safe" ‚Üí NO, test thoroughly after applying
- "Minor version bumps can't break anything" ‚Üí NO, analyze changelog first  
- "The build passes so it's fine" ‚Üí NO, run comprehensive tests
- "Dependencies automatically update" ‚Üí NO, control upgrade process manually

Let me ultrathink about the systematic dependency upgrade strategy for this project.

üö® **REMEMBER: Dependency upgrades can introduce subtle bugs - Test everything!** üö®

**Dependency Upgrade Protocol:**

**Step 0: Dependency Audit and Risk Assessment**
- Run dependency vulnerability scanners (npm audit, go mod audit, etc.)
- Identify outdated packages and their current vs latest versions
- Categorize dependencies: security-critical, major version changes, minor updates
- Document current dependency tree and potential conflict areas

**Step 1: Breaking Change Analysis**
- Review CHANGELOG.md and migration guides for each major upgrade
- Identify API changes, deprecated features, and removed functionality
- Check for compatibility issues between upgraded dependencies
- Assess impact on existing codebase and third-party integrations

**Step 2: Systematic Upgrade Strategy**
Plan upgrades in order of risk and dependency:
- Critical security patches first (immediate priority)
- Major version upgrades requiring code changes (planned approach)
- Minor version updates and patch releases (lower risk batch)
- Development dependencies and tooling updates (separate from production deps)

**Upgrade Quality Requirements:**
- EVERY upgrade must include comprehensive testing
- EVERY major version change must include migration planning
- ZERO functionality regressions - behavior must remain identical
- Breaking changes must be explicitly addressed with code modifications
- Security patches applied within defined SLA timeframes

**For specific ecosystems:**

**Go projects:**
- Use go mod tidy to clean up unused dependencies
- Run go mod audit or govulncheck for security scanning
- Check for module compatibility and replace directives
- Test with go test -race to catch concurrency issues
- Verify build reproducibility with consistent module versions

**Node.js/npm projects:**
- Use npm audit or yarn audit for vulnerability scanning
- Check package-lock.json or yarn.lock for dependency conflicts
- Test with npm ci for clean installation verification
- Run comprehensive test suites including integration tests
- Verify production bundle size hasn't significantly increased

**Python projects:**
- Use pip-audit or safety for security vulnerability scanning
- Check requirements.txt or Pipfile for version constraints
- Test in clean virtual environment to catch missing dependencies
- Run full test suite including compatibility tests
- Verify package compatibility matrix for major upgrades

**Step 3: Incremental Upgrade Execution**
Implement upgrades systematically:
- Start with security patches and critical vulnerabilities
- Upgrade dependencies one category at a time
- Test thoroughly after each upgrade batch
- Rollback immediately if issues detected
- Document any code changes required for compatibility

**Breaking Change Migration Checklist:**
- [ ] All breaking changes identified from changelogs
- [ ] Migration guides reviewed and followed
- [ ] Deprecated API usage updated to current standards
- [ ] Function signatures and return types verified
- [ ] Configuration file formats updated if needed
- [ ] Build scripts and tooling configurations updated
- [ ] Third-party integrations tested for compatibility

**Security and Stability Verification:**
- [ ] All known security vulnerabilities patched
- [ ] No new security issues introduced by upgrades
- [ ] Dependency conflicts resolved properly
- [ ] Build reproducibility maintained
- [ ] Production deployment process tested
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented and tested
- [ ] Performance impact assessed and acceptable

**Comprehensive Testing Requirements:**
- [ ] Unit tests pass for all upgraded components
- [ ] Integration tests verify cross-component compatibility
- [ ] End-to-end tests validate full application workflows
- [ ] Performance tests show no significant degradation
- [ ] Security tests confirm vulnerability remediation
- [ ] Compatibility tests with external services/APIs
- [ ] Load tests verify system stability under production conditions

**Upgrade Documentation and Monitoring:**
- [ ] Upgrade rationale documented with business justification
- [ ] Breaking changes and mitigation strategies recorded
- [ ] Version compatibility matrix updated
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested and documented
- [ ] Monitoring configured for post-upgrade issues
- [ ] Team notified of changes affecting their work areas
- [ ] Production deployment plan includes gradual rollout strategy

**Failure Response Protocol:**
When upgrade issues are found:
1. **IMMEDIATELY SPAWN AGENTS** to handle different upgrade categories in parallel:
   ```
   "Dependency audit revealed 12 outdated packages: 3 with security vulnerabilities,
   4 major version upgrades with breaking changes, and 5 minor updates.
   I'll spawn agents to handle these systematically:
   - Agent 1: Apply critical security patches for packages A, B, C
   - Agent 2: Plan and execute major version upgrades for packages D, E, F, G
   - Agent 3: Handle minor version updates for packages H, I, J, K, L
   Let me tackle these upgrade categories in parallel..."
   ```
2. **ANALYZE SYSTEMATICALLY** - Review breaking changes and plan migration approach
3. **TEST THOROUGHLY** - Run comprehensive test suite after each upgrade
4. **ROLLBACK IF NEEDED** - Immediately revert problematic upgrades
5. **REPEAT** - Continue upgrading until all dependencies are current and secure
6. **NO SHORTCUTS** - Every upgrade decision backed by analysis and testing
7. **ESCALATE** - Only ask for help if blocked after attempting systematic migration

**Final Upgrade Verification:**
The upgrade is complete when:
‚úì All security vulnerabilities resolved with patches applied
‚úì All major version upgrades completed with breaking changes addressed
‚úì ALL test suites pass with zero functionality regressions
‚úì Performance benchmarks show no significant degradation
‚úì Production deployment tested with rollback procedures verified
‚úì Documentation updated with upgrade details and compatibility notes

**Final Commitment:**
I will now execute EVERY upgrade step listed above and VALIDATE ALL CHANGES. I will:
- ‚úÖ Audit dependencies to identify security issues and outdated packages
- ‚úÖ SPAWN MULTIPLE AGENTS to handle different upgrade categories in parallel
- ‚úÖ Analyze breaking changes and plan migration systematically
- ‚úÖ Test comprehensively after every upgrade to ensure functionality
- ‚úÖ Not stop until all dependencies are secure and current

I will NOT:
- ‚ùå Upgrade dependencies without impact analysis
- ‚ùå Skip testing after applying updates
- ‚ùå Ignore breaking changes or migration guides
- ‚ùå Apply upgrades without rollback planning
- ‚ùå Stop at "builds successfully"
- ‚ùå Rush through security patches without testing

**REMEMBER: This is a SYSTEMATIC MIGRATION task, not a bulk update task!**

The upgrade is complete ONLY when every dependency is secure, current, and fully tested.
