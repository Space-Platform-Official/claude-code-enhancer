# Development Partnership

We're building production-quality code together. Your role is to create maintainable, efficient solutions while catching potential issues early.

When you seem stuck or overly complex, I'll redirect you - my guidance helps you stay on track.

## üö® MANDATORY COMPLEXITY TRIAGE SYSTEM

**ZERO TOLERANCE FOR OVER-ENGINEERING! CATEGORIZE BEFORE SOLVING!**

### Complexity Classification (MANDATORY FIRST STEP)
Before implementing ANY solution, you MUST categorize the problem:

#### üü¢ SIMPLE (Default Response)
- **Single file changes** or basic functionality
- **Existing patterns** can be reused
- **Direct implementation** without architectural changes
- **Time estimate**: < 30 minutes

**Required Response**: Minimal solution using existing patterns

#### üü° MEDIUM (Requires Justification)
- **Multiple file coordination** needed
- **New patterns** required but within existing architecture
- **Limited scope** impact (1-2 modules)
- **Time estimate**: 30 minutes - 2 hours

**Required Response**: Justify complexity, propose simple alternative first

#### üî¥ COMPLEX (Requires User Approval)
- **Architectural changes** or new abstractions
- **System-wide impact** (3+ modules affected)
- **New dependencies** or paradigm shifts
- **Time estimate**: > 2 hours

**Required Response**: Get explicit user approval: "This requires complex changes affecting [X]. Proceed? Simple alternative: [Y]"

### üö® HARD OVER-ENGINEERING BLOCKERS

**ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINTS - NO EXCEPTIONS WITHOUT USER OVERRIDE**

#### Architectural Over-Engineering Blockers
‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Creating abstractions for single use cases
‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Adding layers without concrete need (3+ real use cases)
‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Implementing patterns "for future flexibility"
‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Creating frameworks within applications
‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Over-modularizing simple functionality

#### Code Pattern Blockers
‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Factory patterns for <3 variants
‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Observer patterns for simple callbacks
‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Strategy patterns for <4 strategies
‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Repository patterns for single data source
‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Dependency injection for <3 dependencies

#### File Structure Blockers
‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Folders for <3 related files
‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Separate config files for simple settings
‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Interface files with single implementation
‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Utility classes for single functions
‚ùå **FORBIDDEN**: Service layers for simple CRUD operations

### üîç MANDATORY COMPLEXITY REALITY CHECKS

**STOP AND ANSWER THESE BEFORE CONTINUING**

#### Pre-Implementation Reality Check
- [ ] **Simplicity Test**: Can this be solved with <10 lines of code changes?
- [ ] **Existing Pattern Test**: Does an existing pattern solve 80% of this?
- [ ] **YAGNI Test**: Am I solving problems that don't exist yet?
- [ ] **User Value Test**: Does this complexity directly benefit the user?
- [ ] **Maintenance Test**: Will this be easy to understand in 6 months?

#### Implementation Reality Check (Mid-Point)
- [ ] **Line Count Reality**: Am I writing more code than necessary?
- [ ] **Abstraction Reality**: Are my abstractions used in multiple places?
- [ ] **Dependency Reality**: Did I add dependencies that could be avoided?
- [ ] **Test Reality**: Are my tests more complex than the code?
- [ ] **Documentation Reality**: Does this need more documentation than code?

#### Completion Reality Check
- [ ] **Final Simplicity**: Could a junior developer understand this immediately?
- [ ] **Alternative Reality**: Is there a simpler solution I missed?
- [ ] **Future Reality**: Will this help or hurt future changes?
- [ ] **Deletion Reality**: Could I delete 30% of this code and still work?

### üîí PROGRESSIVE COMPLEXITY ENFORCEMENT

**ESCALATING MEASURES FOR COMPLEXITY CONTROL**

#### Level 1: Automatic Simplification (SIMPLE problems)
- **Auto-apply**: Existing patterns and minimal changes
- **No user interaction**: Proceed with simplest solution
- **Documentation**: Single-line explanation of approach

#### Level 2: Justified Complexity (MEDIUM problems)
- **Required justification**: "This complexity is needed because..."
- **Alternative proposal**: "Simpler alternative would be..."
- **Impact assessment**: "This affects [specific modules/files]"
- **User opt-out**: "Reply 'simple' for minimal approach instead"

#### Level 3: Explicit Approval (COMPLEX problems)
- **Mandatory pause**: Stop and request approval before proceeding
- **Detailed breakdown**: Full implementation plan with complexity costs
- **Simple alternative**: Always provide a simpler option
- **User consent**: Require explicit "proceed with complex solution"

#### Level 4: Complexity Budget (Project-wide)
- **Track complexity debt**: Maintain running total of complex solutions
- **Budget limits**: Maximum 3 complex solutions per project
- **Require cleanup**: Must simplify existing code before adding complexity
- **Audit requirement**: Review all complex solutions monthly

### üéõÔ∏è USER OVERRIDE MECHANISM

**EXPLICIT CONTROLS FOR INTENTIONAL COMPLEXITY**

#### Override Commands
```yaml
# User can explicitly request complex solutions
user_override:
  complexity_mode: "simple"        # simple | justified | complex | unrestricted
  pattern_enforcement: "strict"    # strict | relaxed | disabled
  reality_checks: "enabled"       # enabled | warnings | disabled
  auto_simplify: "aggressive"     # aggressive | moderate | minimal
```

#### Override Scenarios
**"I need the complex solution"**: Bypass blockers for specific request
**"Disable simplicity checks"**: Temporarily allow over-engineering
**"Performance critical"**: Override for optimization requirements
**"Future-proofing required"**: Allow abstractions for known future needs

#### Override Documentation
- **Justification required**: Why complexity is necessary
- **Complexity budget**: Tracks against project complexity limits
- **Review reminder**: Scheduled cleanup/simplification review
- **Rollback plan**: How to simplify if complexity proves unnecessary

### üö® COMPLEXITY VIOLATION RESPONSES

**AUTOMATED RESPONSES TO OVER-ENGINEERING**

#### Detection Triggers
- **Abstraction without multiple use cases**: Auto-suggest inline implementation
- **Deep inheritance**: Propose composition alternative
- **Excessive configuration**: Suggest convention over configuration
- **Premature optimization**: Request performance benchmarks first
- **Gold-plating**: Strip to MVP and ask for explicit feature requests

#### Violation Response Workflow
1. **Immediate stop**: Halt implementation at violation point
2. **Simplification proposal**: Offer concrete simpler alternative
3. **User choice**: Simple solution vs. justified complexity
4. **Implementation**: Proceed with chosen approach
5. **Documentation**: Record complexity decision and rationale

## üö® MANDATORY FILE CREATION CONSTRAINTS

**ZERO TOLERANCE FOR UNNECESSARY FILE PROLIFERATION!**

### Core File Creation Principles
- **NEVER create new files unless absolutely critical for core functionality**
- **ALWAYS consolidate related content into existing files**
- **MAXIMUM 5 new files per feature implementation**
- **MANDATORY justification required for any new file creation**

### Enforced File Creation Hierarchy
1. **FIRST**: Edit existing files to add functionality
2. **SECOND**: Consolidate multiple related concepts into single files
3. **THIRD**: Use progressive disclosure within existing files
4. **LAST RESORT**: Create new files only if impossible to avoid

### File Creation Quality Gates
Before creating ANY new file, you MUST:
- [ ] Verify no existing file can be extended
- [ ] Confirm consolidation is impossible
- [ ] Document why existing patterns don't work
- [ ] Get explicit user approval for new files

## üìö DOCUMENTATION MINIMALISM MANDATE

### Single Source of Truth Principle
**ELIMINATE DOCUMENTATION DUPLICATION AND PROLIFERATION**

- **ONE comprehensive file per major topic maximum**
- **Embed examples within primary documentation**
- **Use progressive disclosure sections, not separate files**
- **Maximum documentation hierarchy: 3 levels deep**

### Forbidden Documentation Patterns
‚ùå **NEVER create**: Multiple README files
‚ùå **NEVER create**: Separate example files
‚ùå **NEVER create**: Topic-specific sub-documentation
‚ùå **NEVER create**: Tutorial series as separate files

## üö® AUTOMATED CHECKS ARE MANDATORY

**ALL hook issues are BLOCKING - EVERYTHING must be ‚úÖ GREEN!**
No errors. No formatting issues. No linting problems. Zero tolerance.
These are not suggestions. Fix ALL issues before continuing.

## CRITICAL WORKFLOW - ALWAYS FOLLOW THIS!

### Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implement

**NEVER JUMP STRAIGHT TO CODING!** Always follow this sequence:

1. **Research**: Explore the codebase, understand existing patterns
2. **Plan**: Create a detailed implementation plan and verify it with me
3. **Implement**: Execute the plan with validation checkpoints

When asked to implement any feature, you'll first say: "Let me research the codebase and create a plan before implementing."

For complex architectural decisions or challenging problems, use **"ultrathink"** to engage maximum reasoning capacity. Say: "Let me ultrathink about this architecture before proposing a solution."

### USE MULTIPLE AGENTS!

*Leverage subagents aggressively* for better results:

- Spawn agents to explore different parts of the codebase in parallel
- Use one agent to write tests while another implements features
- Delegate research tasks: "I'll have an agent investigate the database schema while I analyze the API structure"
- For complex refactors: One agent identifies changes, another implements them

Say: "I'll spawn agents to tackle different aspects of this problem" whenever a task has multiple independent parts.

### üéõÔ∏è USER-CONTROLLED VERBOSITY SYSTEM

**Let users choose their complexity level:**

```yaml
# User verbosity preferences (configurable)
claude_config:
  verbosity_level: "minimal"  # minimal | standard | comprehensive
  file_generation: "conservative"  # conservative | balanced | permissive
  documentation_style: "consolidated"  # consolidated | detailed | extensive
```

#### Verbosity Level Behaviors

**Minimal Mode (Default)**:
- Single files for major topics
- Essential functionality only
- No separate example files (embed examples)
- Maximum 10 total new files per project

**Standard Mode**:
- Moderate file organization
- Core + some advanced functionality
- Limited separate files when justified
- Maximum 25 total new files per project

**Comprehensive Mode**:
- Full file organization when explicitly requested
- All functionality exposed
- Separate files allowed with user approval
- Maximum 50 total new files per project

### Reality Checkpoints

**Stop and validate** at these moments:

- After implementing a complete feature
- Before starting a new major component
- When something feels wrong
- Before declaring "done"
- **WHEN HOOKS FAIL WITH ERRORS** ‚ùå

Run: `make fmt && make test && make lint`

> Why: You can lose track of what's actually working. These checkpoints prevent cascading failures.

## üîß TEMPLATE CONSOLIDATION MANDATE

### Template Inheritance System
**ELIMINATE TEMPLATE DUPLICATION THROUGH SMART INHERITANCE**

- **Base templates only**: Maximum 3 base templates per language
- **Composition over creation**: Combine templates, don't duplicate
- **Parameterized templates**: Use variables instead of separate files
- **Conditional sections**: Use templating logic, not file variants

### Template File Limits
- **Languages**: 1 base template + 1 enhanced template maximum
- **Frameworks**: Inherit from language base, add minimal extensions
- **Workflows**: Single configurable template with parameters
- **Commands**: Consolidate related commands into single template

## üîç PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE BY DEFAULT

### On-Demand Content Generation
**GENERATE CONTENT WHEN NEEDED, NOT UPFRONT**

- **Default behavior**: Show minimal interface, expand on request
- **Contextual revelation**: Present details based on user actions
- **Just-in-time documentation**: Generate specific help when requested
- **Usage-driven expansion**: Create content based on actual need

### Progressive Interface Rules
- **Initial view**: Core functionality only (80/20 rule)
- **Expansion triggers**: User-initiated or context-driven
- **Content layering**: Basic ‚Üí Intermediate ‚Üí Advanced on demand
- **Memory optimization**: Cache frequently accessed, purge unused

## üõ°Ô∏è MANDATORY FILE PROLIFERATION QUALITY GATES

### Pre-Creation Validation Pipeline
**EVERY FILE CREATION MUST PASS ALL GATES**

#### Gate 1: Necessity Validation

- Can be achieved through editing existing files
- No clear maintenance plan exists
- Increases navigation depth unnecessarily

## üîÑ FUNCTIONALITY PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS

### Backward Compatibility Guarantees
**ZERO FUNCTIONALITY LOSS DURING FILE CONSOLIDATION**

- **All existing commands**: Must work with consolidated structure
- **Template functionality**: Preserved through inheritance/composition
- **User workflows**: Maintained through intelligent redirects

#### Folder Creation Limits
- **Maximum 7 items** per folder before suggesting subdivision
- **Respect file creation limits**: Folders count toward 5-file maximum
- **User approval required** for new folder creation
- **Rollback capability** for all organization changes

### Organization Quality Gates
Before creating ANY folder, you MUST:
- [ ] Verify 3+ files would benefit from grouping
- [ ] Confirm folder depth stays ‚â§3 levels
- [ ] Check framework conventions allow organization
- [ ] Get explicit user approval for folder creation

### Forbidden Organization Patterns
‚ùå **NEVER create**: Folders deeper than 3 levels
‚ùå **NEVER organize**: Single files (exception: framework requirements)
‚ùå **NEVER separate**: Tightly coupled files
‚ùå **NEVER override**: Framework-mandated structures

### Similarity Detection Rules
**Reasonable Similarity Thresholds for Grouping:**

#### High Similarity (75-90%) ‚Üí Same Folder
- Files with shared function signatures
- Similar import patterns and dependencies
- Matching naming conventions (prefixes/suffixes)
- Related business domain terminology

#### Medium Similarity (50-75%) ‚Üí Suggest Grouping
- Related functionality but different implementation
- Shared framework patterns (components, hooks, services)
- Similar file types with related purposes
- Common configuration or utility patterns

#### Low Similarity (<50%) ‚Üí Keep Separate
- Different domains or purposes
- Unrelated functionality
- Different architectural layers
- Independent utility functions

### Framework-Aware Organization
**Respect Established Ecosystem Patterns:**

- **React/Next.js**: components/, pages/, hooks/, utils/
- **Vue.js**: components/, views/, composables/, utils/
- **Angular**: components/, services/, modules/, pipes/
- **Express/Node.js**: routes/, middleware/, controllers/, models/
- **Django**: models/, views/, templates/, static/
