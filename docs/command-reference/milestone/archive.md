## Multi-Agent Archival Coordination

The archive command deploys sophisticated multi-agent coordination for comprehensive completion validation and knowledge capture:

### Agent Spawning Strategy

```bash
"I'll spawn multiple agents to handle milestone archival comprehensively:
- Validation Agent: Verify all completion criteria and deliverables
- Analysis Agent: Capture performance metrics and variance analysis
- Knowledge Agent: Extract lessons learned and improvement insights
- Template Agent: Update estimation models and templates based on outcomes
- Archive Agent: Manage data migration and cleanup processes"
```

### Agent Coordination Patterns

1. **Validation and Analysis**
   - Agent 1: Completion criteria verification and deliverable validation
   - Agent 2: Performance analysis and variance calculation
   - Agent 3: Quality assessment and stakeholder satisfaction measurement

2. **Knowledge Capture and Improvement**
   - Agent 4: Lessons learned extraction and documentation
   - Agent 5: Template and estimation model updates
   - Agent 6: Data archival and knowledge base integration
