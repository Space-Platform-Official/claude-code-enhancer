# üö® CRITICAL ROLLBACK PROCEDURE EXECUTION üö®

**THIS IS NOT A PLANNING TASK - THIS IS A ROLLBACK IMPLEMENTATION TASK!**

When you run `/rollback`, you are REQUIRED to:

1. **CREATE** comprehensive rollback plans and procedures
2. **IMPLEMENT SAFE ROLLBACK MECHANISMS** with data protection
3. **USE MULTIPLE AGENTS** to handle rollback complexity:
   - Spawn one agent for data migration reversals
   - Spawn another for application rollback procedures
   - Spawn agents for different services/components
   - Say: "I'll spawn multiple agents to execute safe rollback procedures in parallel"
4. **DO NOT STOP** until:
   - ‚úÖ Complete rollback plan is documented and tested
   - ‚úÖ Data migration reversals are safe and verified
   - ‚úÖ Application rollback is tested in staging
   - ‚úÖ Verification procedures are in place

**FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS:**
- ‚ùå "Just revert the git commits" ‚Üí NO! Need comprehensive data safety!
- ‚ùå "The rollback looks straightforward" ‚Üí NO! Test it thoroughly!
- ‚ùå "Data migrations can't be reversed" ‚Üí NO! Create safe procedures!
- ‚ùå Stopping after basic planning ‚Üí NO! IMPLEMENT AND TEST!

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**
```
1. Analyze current state ‚Üí Identify rollback scope
2. IMMEDIATELY spawn agents to create rollback procedures
3. Test rollback in staging ‚Üí Validate all procedures
4. Document verification steps
5. REPEAT until rollback is completely safe and tested
```

**YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL:**
- Complete rollback procedures are documented
- Data rollback is tested and verified safe
- Application rollback works in staging environment
- All verification steps are automated or documented

üõë **MANDATORY PRE-ROLLBACK CHECK** üõë
1. Re-read ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md RIGHT NOW
2. Check current TODO.md status
3. Understand the scope and risks of rollback

Execute comprehensive rollback procedure for: $ARGUMENTS

**FORBIDDEN EXCUSE PATTERNS:**
- "Rollbacks are risky, let's move forward" ‚Üí NO, create safe procedures
- "The data can't be rolled back" ‚Üí NO, find a safe way
- "It's too complex to rollback" ‚Üí NO, break it down systematically
- "We'll handle rollback manually if needed" ‚Üí NO, automate it
- "Forward fixes are easier" ‚Üí NO, prepare proper rollback anyway

Let me ultrathink about creating comprehensive, safe rollback procedures with zero data loss risk.

üö® **REMEMBER: Data safety is paramount - never risk data corruption!** üö®

**Safe Rollback Procedure Protocol:**

**Step 0: Rollback Scope Analysis**
- Identify all components affected by the change
- Map data dependencies and migration sequences
- Analyze configuration changes and feature flags
- Document current production state as baseline

**Step 1: Risk Assessment**
- Identify irreversible operations (data deletions, schema changes)
- Map external service integrations affected
- Assess downtime requirements and business impact
- Identify rollback complexity and dependencies

**Step 2: Data Safety Planning**
Run comprehensive data analysis:
- Create database backups before any rollback
- Design migration reversal scripts with validation
- Plan for data consistency checks
- Prepare data reconciliation procedures

**Critical Safety Requirements:**
- ZERO data loss during rollback procedures
- Maintain referential integrity at all times
- Preserve user data and transaction history
- Validate data consistency before and after
- Create audit trail of all rollback operations
- Test rollback procedures in staging first

**For Database Rollbacks specifically:**
- Create point-in-time recovery options
- Design reversible migration scripts
- Test schema downgrades thoroughly
- Validate foreign key constraints
- Preserve data relationships
- Plan for large dataset handling

**Step 3: Agent Spawning for Rollback Implementation**
When rollback procedures need implementation, spawn agents strategically:
```
"I need to create comprehensive rollback procedures for this deployment. I'll spawn agents to handle different aspects:
- Agent 1: Database migration reversal scripts and testing
- Agent 2: Application configuration rollback procedures
- Agent 3: External service integration rollback
- Agent 4: Feature flag and A/B test rollback
- Agent 5: Monitoring and verification automation
Let me tackle all of these rollback components in parallel..."
```

**Rollback Component Requirements:**
- [ ] Database schema rollback scripts tested and validated
- [ ] Data migration reversal procedures documented
- [ ] Application configuration rollback automated
- [ ] External service integration rollback planned
- [ ] Feature flag rollback procedures ready
- [ ] Cache invalidation and cleanup automated
- [ ] Load balancer and routing rollback ready

**Database Rollback Best Practices:**
- [ ] Create pre-rollback database snapshots
- [ ] Write and test migration DOWN scripts
- [ ] Validate rollback with production-like data
- [ ] Plan for zero-downtime rollback when possible
- [ ] Document data reconciliation procedures
- [ ] Test rollback performance with large datasets
- [ ] Prepare for partial rollback scenarios

**Application Rollback Guidelines:**
- Create staged rollback procedures (blue-green deployment)
- Plan for configuration rollback sequences
- Document service dependency rollback order
- Prepare for API version rollback scenarios
- Test rollback with real user sessions
- Validate external integrations after rollback

**Rollback Verification Strategy:**
Create comprehensive verification for:
1. **Data Integrity** (all data relationships preserved)
2. **Functional Verification** (all features work correctly)
3. **Performance Validation** (no performance degradation)
4. **Integration Testing** (external services work)
5. **User Experience** (no broken user flows)

**Failure Response Protocol:**
When rollback risks are identified:
1. **IMMEDIATELY SPAWN AGENTS** to address risks in parallel
2. **IMPLEMENT SAFETY MEASURES** - Add validation and checks
3. **TEST THOROUGHLY** - Validate in staging environment
4. **DOCUMENT EVERYTHING** - Create runbooks and procedures
5. **NO SHORTCUTS** - Don't skip safety validations
6. **ESCALATE SAFELY** - If rollback is too risky, document why

**Agent Task Distribution Patterns:**

**Pattern A: Component-Based Rollback**
```
Agent 1: Frontend application rollback (code, assets, configs)
Agent 2: Backend API rollback (services, middleware, routing)
Agent 3: Database rollback (schema, data, migrations)
Agent 4: Infrastructure rollback (containers, configs, secrets)
```

**Pattern B: Risk-Based Distribution**
```
Agent 1: High-risk data operations (irreversible changes)
Agent 2: Medium-risk application changes (configs, features)
Agent 3: Low-risk presentation changes (UI, styling)
Agent 4: Verification and validation automation
```

**Pattern C: Service-Based Rollback**
```
Agent 1: User service rollback (auth, profiles, sessions)
Agent 2: Order service rollback (processing, fulfillment)
Agent 3: Payment service rollback (transactions, billing)
Agent 4: Notification service rollback (emails, alerts)
```

**Rollback Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] Rollback procedures tested in staging environment
- [ ] Data migration reversals validated with test data
- [ ] Performance impact of rollback measured
- [ ] User experience validated post-rollback
- [ ] External integrations tested after rollback
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting works correctly
- [ ] Rollback timing and downtime measured
- [ ] Recovery procedures documented and tested

**Emergency Rollback Procedures:**
- Document fast rollback for critical issues
- Create automated rollback triggers and alerts
- Prepare communication templates for stakeholders
- Plan for partial rollback scenarios
- Document decision criteria for emergency rollback
- Test emergency procedures regularly

**Final Rollback Verification:**
The rollback procedures are complete when:
‚úì All rollback scripts are tested and validated
‚úì Data safety is guaranteed with backups and validation
‚úì Staging environment rollback test passes completely
‚úì Verification procedures are automated or documented
‚úì Emergency rollback procedures are ready
‚úì All stakeholders understand rollback impact

**Final Commitment:**
I will now create and implement comprehensive rollback procedures and TEST EVERYTHING. I will:
- ‚úÖ Analyze rollback scope and create detailed procedures
- ‚úÖ SPAWN MULTIPLE AGENTS to implement rollback components
- ‚úÖ Keep working until rollback is completely tested and safe
- ‚úÖ Not stop until all verification procedures are in place

I will NOT:
- ‚ùå Just document rollback steps without testing them
- ‚ùå Skip data safety validations
- ‚ùå Accept "probably works" rollback procedures
- ‚ùå Stop at partial rollback implementation
- ‚ùå Ignore complex data migration reversals
- ‚ùå Stop working while ANY rollback risks remain

**REMEMBER: This is a ROLLBACK IMPLEMENTATION task, not a documentation task!**

The rollback is ready ONLY when all procedures are tested, validated, and guaranteed safe for production use.

**Executing comprehensive rollback procedure creation and TESTING ALL PROCEDURES NOW...**
