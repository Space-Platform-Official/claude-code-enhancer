# üîç‚ö°üö® CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: COMPREHENSIVE THINK-THROUGH MODE ENGAGED

**THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE ANALYSIS OR IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION - THIS IS A COMPREHENSIVE THINK-THROUGH TASK!**

When you run `/thinkthrough`, you are REQUIRED to:

1. **ANALYZE** the problem comprehensively with deep reasoning (ultrathink-level depth)
2. **EVALUATE** multiple solution approaches and automatically select the optimal one
3. **REQUEST** explicit user permission before any implementation
4. **IMPLEMENT** the approved solution with full execution capability
5. **USE MULTIPLE AGENTS STRATEGICALLY** for parallel analysis and execution:
   - Spawn agents for different aspects of problem analysis
   - Deploy evaluation agents for solution comparison
   - Use implementation agents for parallel execution after approval
   - Say: "I'll spawn agents to think through this comprehensively before seeking permission"

**FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS:**
- ‚ùå "Jump to quick solution without deep analysis" ‚Üí NO! Comprehensive reasoning required!
- ‚ùå "Present multiple options to user" ‚Üí NO! Auto-select optimal solution!
- ‚ùå "Implement without explicit permission" ‚Üí NO! Permission gate is mandatory!
- ‚ùå "Skip analysis depth for simple problems" ‚Üí NO! Always think through thoroughly!
- ‚ùå "Force user to choose between options" ‚Üí NO! Provide single optimal recommendation!

**MANDATORY THINK-THROUGH WORKFLOW:**
```
1. THINK_MODE: Deep comprehensive analysis with agent deployment
2. THROUGH_MODE: Solution evaluation and automatic optimal selection
3. ASK_MODE: Permission request with clear implementation scope
4. EXECUTE_MODE: Full implementation after user approval
```

**YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL:**
- ‚úÖ Problem analyzed comprehensively from multiple angles
- ‚úÖ Multiple solutions evaluated with automatic optimal selection
- ‚úÖ Single best solution identified with clear justification
- ‚úÖ User permission explicitly requested and granted
- ‚úÖ Implementation completed successfully with validation

---

üõë **MANDATORY THINK-THROUGH PROTOCOL** üõë
1. Re-read ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md RIGHT NOW
2. Check current TODO.md status
3. Engage deep reasoning without implementation pressure
4. Auto-select optimal solution based on comprehensive evaluation
5. Request explicit permission before any code changes

Execute comprehensive think-through analysis with ZERO tolerance for shortcuts.

**FORBIDDEN SHORTCUT PATTERNS:**
- "Skip deep analysis for obvious solutions" ‚Üí NO, always think through completely
- "Present multiple options by default" ‚Üí NO, auto-select the optimal approach
- "Assume permission for simple changes" ‚Üí NO, always request explicit approval
- "Rush to implementation" ‚Üí NO, thorough analysis first

You are thinking through: $ARGUMENTS

Let me think through this challenge comprehensively with automatic solution selection and permission control.

üö® **REMEMBER: Comprehensive reasoning, optimal selection, permission gate, then execution!** üö®

## üîç PHASE 1: COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS MODE

**Step 1: Problem Decomposition and Multi-Agent Analysis**
Deploy specialized analysis agents for comprehensive understanding:

```
"I need to think through this challenge comprehensively. I'll spawn analysis agents:
- Problem Analysis Agent: Break down core challenges and constraints
- Context Research Agent: Investigate existing patterns and dependencies  
- Solution Space Agent: Explore all viable solution approaches
- Risk Assessment Agent: Identify potential issues and edge cases
- Requirements Agent: Map functional and non-functional requirements
Let me analyze this problem thoroughly from all angles..."
```

**Comprehensive Analysis Requirements:**
- [ ] Problem scope and boundaries clearly defined
- [ ] All constraints and requirements identified
- [ ] Existing patterns and dependencies mapped
- [ ] Multiple solution approaches explored
- [ ] Risk factors and edge cases evaluated
- [ ] Success criteria established

**Step 2: Deep Context Investigation**
Thorough investigation of problem context:
- [ ] Analyze existing codebase patterns and conventions
- [ ] Identify integration points and dependencies
- [ ] Map potential impact areas and side effects
- [ ] Evaluate non-functional requirements (performance, maintainability)
- [ ] Research similar problems and established solutions
- [ ] Document architectural constraints and opportunities

## ‚ö° PHASE 2: SOLUTION EVALUATION AND AUTO-SELECTION

**Step 3: Multiple Solution Generation**
Generate comprehensive solution alternatives:
- [ ] Identify minimum 3 distinct solution approaches
- [ ] Design detailed implementation strategy for each
- [ ] Map resource requirements and complexity
- [ ] Evaluate trade-offs and implications
- [ ] Consider short-term and long-term consequences

**Step 4: Automatic Optimal Solution Selection**
Deploy evaluation agents for systematic comparison:

```
"I'll spawn evaluation agents to select the optimal solution automatically:
- Criteria Agent: Establish evaluation framework and scoring matrix
- Analysis Agent: Score each solution against multiple criteria
- Trade-off Agent: Evaluate pros/cons and implementation complexity
- Selection Agent: Identify single optimal solution with justification
- Validation Agent: Verify selection logic and recommendation quality"
```

**Solution Selection Criteria:**
- [ ] Implementation complexity and effort
- [ ] Performance and scalability implications
- [ ] Maintainability and future extensibility
- [ ] Risk level and potential failure modes
- [ ] Alignment with existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Resource requirements and dependencies

## üö® PHASE 3: PERMISSION REQUEST MODE

**Step 5: Structured Permission Request**
Present optimal solution with explicit approval request:

**PROBLEM SUMMARY:**
[Clear, concise problem description]

**OPTIMAL SOLUTION SELECTED:**
[Single recommended solution with implementation approach]

**JUSTIFICATION:**
[Why this solution beats alternatives - specific reasoning]

**IMPLEMENTATION SCOPE:**
- Files to be modified: [specific list]
- New files to be created: [if any]
- Dependencies affected: [impact assessment]
- Estimated complexity: [time/effort estimate]

**RISKS AND MITIGATIONS:**
- Potential issues: [identified risks]
- Mitigation strategies: [how to handle risks]
- Rollback plan: [if things go wrong]

**üî¥ PERMISSION REQUIRED:**
**PROCEED with implementation of the selected solution? (PROCEED/ANALYZE)**
- Type "PROCEED" to authorize implementation
- Type "ANALYZE" to see alternative solutions or refinements

## üö° PHASE 4: IMPLEMENTATION EXECUTION MODE

**Step 6: Parallel Implementation Execution** (ONLY after explicit permission)
Deploy implementation agents for efficient execution:

```
"Permission granted! I'll spawn implementation agents for parallel execution:
- Planning Agent: Create detailed implementation roadmap
- Core Implementation Agent: Handle primary code changes
- Integration Agent: Manage dependencies and integration points
- Testing Agent: Validate implementation at each step
- Quality Agent: Ensure standards compliance and optimization"
```

**Implementation Requirements:**
- [ ] Follow established coding standards and patterns
- [ ] Implement with proper error handling and validation
- [ ] Maintain existing functionality and compatibility
- [ ] Include appropriate documentation and comments
- [ ] Validate implementation at each major step

**Step 7: Quality Validation and Verification**
Comprehensive validation of implemented solution:
- [ ] All success criteria met and validated
- [ ] Integration points working correctly
- [ ] No regressions or breaking changes introduced
- [ ] Performance implications acceptable
- [ ] Documentation updated and accurate
- [ ] Implementation ready for production use
