## Multi-Agent Architecture Analysis

The architect command deploys sophisticated multi-agent coordination for comprehensive analysis:

### Agent Spawning Strategy

```bash
"I'll spawn multiple agents to analyze this architecture from different perspectives:
- Current State Analysis Agent: Map existing architecture and technical debt
- Requirements Analysis Agent: Gather constraints and non-functional requirements
- Pattern Research Agent: Research industry patterns and best practices
- Options Evaluation Agent: Generate and compare architectural alternatives
- Risk Assessment Agent: Analyze risks, trade-offs, and complexity factors
- Implementation Planning Agent: Create detailed roadmaps and ADRs"
```

### Agent Coordination Patterns

1. **Analysis Phase Coordination**
   - Agent 1: Current architecture mapping and assessment
   - Agent 2: Requirements gathering and constraint analysis
   - Agent 3: Industry research and pattern analysis

2. **Design Phase Coordination**
   - Agent 4: Architecture option generation and modeling
   - Agent 5: Trade-off analysis and risk assessment
   - Agent 6: Documentation and roadmap generation
