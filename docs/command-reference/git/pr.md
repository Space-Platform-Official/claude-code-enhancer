## Multi-Agent Coordination

The PR command leverages multi-agent spawning for parallel operations:

### Agent Spawning Strategy

```bash
"I'll spawn multiple agents to manage PR operations comprehensively:
- Analysis Agent: Analyze PR changes and impact assessment
- Quality Agent: Run quality checks and validation gates
- CI/CD Agent: Monitor continuous integration status
- Review Agent: Manage review process and collaboration
- Documentation Agent: Generate and maintain PR templates"
```

### Agent Coordination Patterns

1. **Comprehensive PR Creation**
   - Agent 1: PR Analysis & Quality Checks
   - Agent 2: CI/CD Integration & Status Monitoring
   - Agent 3: Review Management & Collaboration
   - Agent 4: Documentation & Template Generation

2. **Quality-Focused Review**
   - Agent 1: Code Quality Review
   - Agent 2: Security Review
   - Agent 3: Performance Review
   - Agent 4: Documentation Review

3. **Safe Merge Validation**
   - Agent 1: Pre-merge validation
   - Agent 2: Conflict detection and resolution
   - Agent 3: Quality gate enforcement
   - Agent 4: Post-merge cleanup

## Workflow Examples

### Create Pull Request

```bash
# Basic PR creation with quality validation
/git/pr create

# Create draft PR for work in progress
/git/pr create --draft

# Create PR targeting specific branch
/git/pr create --base=develop
```

**Process Flow**:
1. Validates PR readiness (tests, linting, no sensitive data)
2. Analyzes branch changes and impact
3. Generates intelligent PR template
4. Creates PR with automated labeling and reviewer assignment
5. Sets up PR automation and monitoring

### Review Pull Request

```bash
# Review current branch's PR
/git/pr review

# Review specific PR interactively
/git/pr review 123 --interactive

# Quick review status check
/git/pr review 123
```

**Review Features**:
- Comprehensive change analysis
- Quality check automation
- Interactive review process
- Comment management
- Approval/change request workflow

### Merge Pull Request

```bash
# Safe merge with default strategy
/git/pr merge

# Merge with specific strategy
/git/pr merge --strategy=rebase

# Merge specific PR
/git/pr merge 123 --strategy=squash
```

**Safety Validations**:
- PR approval status check
- CI/CD status validation
- Merge conflict detection
- Branch protection compliance
- Post-merge cleanup

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Creation Validation

The command enforces strict quality gates before PR creation:

```bash
# Quality validation checklist
‚úÖ Tests must pass
‚úÖ Linting issues resolved
‚úÖ No sensitive data detected
‚úÖ Commit messages validated
‚úÖ Branch is properly synced
```

### Review Quality Checks

Automated quality analysis during review:

```bash
# Quality assessment areas
üìä Change statistics and complexity
üéØ Change pattern identification  
üîç Code quality metrics
üîê Security scanning
‚ö° Performance impact analysis
```

### Merge Safety Checks

Comprehensive validation before merge:

```bash
# Merge validation gates
‚úÖ PR approval requirements met
‚úÖ CI/CD checks passing
‚úÖ No merge conflicts
‚úÖ Branch protection compliance
‚úÖ Quality thresholds satisfied
```

   # Linting issues
   ‚ùå Linting issues - fix before creating PR
   
   # Sensitive data detected
   ‚ùå Sensitive data detected - remove before creating PR
   ```

2. **Merge Failures**
   ```bash
   # PR not approved
   ‚ö†Ô∏è PR not approved yet - waiting for review
   
   # CI checks failed
   ‚ùå CI checks failed: [specific checks]
   
   # Merge conflicts
   ‚ùå PR has conflicts - resolve before merging
   ```

### Recovery Procedures

Each error includes specific recovery instructions:

```bash
# Example recovery for failing tests
echo "Fix failing tests and run:"
echo "  npm test  # or framework-specific command"
echo "  /git/pr update"
```
