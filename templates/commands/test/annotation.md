# üìùüìùüìù CRITICAL ANNOTATION ANALYSIS: COMPREHENSIVE BIDIRECTIONAL LINKAGE VALIDATION! üìùüìùüìù

**THIS IS NOT TEST EXECUTION - THIS IS COMPREHENSIVE ANNOTATION COVERAGE ANALYSIS!**

**üö® NOTE: This command analyzes existing annotations - it does NOT execute tests! üö®**

When you run `/test annotation`, you are REQUIRED to:

1. **SCAN** all source methods and test methods for @Verified and @TestedBy annotations
2. **VALIDATE** bidirectional method-to-test-case linkage at the method level
3. **VERIFY** that source methods have @Verified annotations pointing to specific test methods
4. **ENSURE** that test methods have @TestedBy annotations pointing to specific source methods
5. **FIX** annotation issues automatically with safe mode validation
6. **REPORT** comprehensive validation results with actionable recommendations
7. **USE MULTIPLE AGENTS** for parallel annotation processing with Task tool

**FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS:**
- ‚ùå "Basic annotation check" ‚Üí NO! Use comprehensive method-level bidirectional validation!
- ‚ùå "Class-level annotation validation" ‚Üí NO! Must validate at method level!
- ‚ùå "Skip method-to-test-case mapping" ‚Üí NO! Method-level linkage analysis required!
- ‚ùå "Ignore orphaned methods" ‚Üí NO! All methods must have corresponding test annotations!
- ‚ùå "Single-threaded validation" ‚Üí NO! Use parallel agent coordination!
- ‚ùå "Generic annotation output" ‚Üí NO! Method-specific parsing and reporting!
- ‚ùå "Bash functions instead of Task tool" ‚Üí NO! Use proper Task tool agents!

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**
```
1. PHP annotation system detection ‚Üí Identify annotation-automation.php
2. IMMEDIATELY spawn 5 agents for parallel method-level validation using Task tool
3. Method discovery ‚Üí Find all public methods in source classes
4. Annotation discovery ‚Üí Find all @Verified and @TestedBy annotations at method level
5. Parallel validation ‚Üí Run method-to-test-case linkage validation across multiple agents
6. Bidirectional linkage analysis ‚Üí Validate method-level consistency
7. VERIFY results ‚Üí Ensure all methods have valid test linkages and coverage complete
```

## TASK TOOL AGENT IMPLEMENTATION

I'll spawn 5 specialized agents using Task tool for comprehensive annotation analysis:

### Test Scanner Agent

<function_calls>
<invoke name="Task">
<parameter name="subagent_type">test-fixer</parameter>
<parameter name="description">Scan test files for annotations</parameter>
<parameter name="prompt">You are the Test Scanner Agent for PHP annotation analysis.

Your responsibilities:
1. Discover all PHP test files in the project (typically in test/, tests/, or Cases/ directories)
2. Scan each test file for @TestedBy annotations on test methods
3. Extract test method names and their corresponding @TestedBy target methods
4. Identify test files with missing @TestedBy annotations
5. Generate comprehensive test file inventory with annotation status

Implementation steps:
- Use Glob to find all PHP test files (*.php in test directories)
- Use Grep to search for @TestedBy annotations and test methods
- Parse annotation syntax: @TestedBy(method="ClassName::methodName")
- Map test methods to their target source methods
- Report orphaned test methods (tests without @TestedBy annotations)

Save your results to /tmp/test-scanner-results.json for coordination with other agents.

Focus specifically on PHP test annotation patterns and provide detailed method-level mapping.</parameter>

üõë **MANDATORY ANNOTATION VALIDATION PROTOCOL** üõë
1. Re-read ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md RIGHT NOW
2. Check PHP annotation system configuration
3. Verify annotation-automation.php accessibility
4. **SPAWN ALL 5 AGENTS IMMEDIATELY** using Task tool for parallel processing

Execute comprehensive annotation validation with ZERO tolerance for incomplete linkage analysis.

**FORBIDDEN SHORTCUT PATTERNS:**
- "Basic annotation scan is sufficient" ‚Üí NO, comprehensive validation required
- "Skip slow validation for speed" ‚Üí NO, all annotations must be validated
- "Linkage reports are optional" ‚Üí NO, mandatory linkage analysis
- "Manual annotation analysis is fine" ‚Üí NO, automated analysis required
- "Single agent validation is faster" ‚Üí NO, parallel validation mandatory
- "Bash functions instead of Task tool" ‚Üí NO, use proper Task tool agents

You are validating annotations for: $ARGUMENTS

Let me ultrathink about comprehensive annotation validation with parallel agent coordination.

üö® **REMEMBER: Annotations are the foundation of test-source linkage reliability!** üö®

**YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL:**
- ‚úÖ All 5 agents have been spawned using Task tool and completed their analysis
- ‚úÖ All public methods discovered and scanned for annotations
- ‚úÖ Method-level bidirectional linkage analyzed with gap identification
- ‚úÖ All source methods have @Verified annotations pointing to specific test methods
- ‚úÖ All test methods have @TestedBy annotations pointing to specific source methods
- ‚úÖ Orphaned methods identified and reported
- ‚úÖ Invalid method-to-test-case mappings analyzed with root cause identification
- ‚úÖ Method-level coverage metrics collected and reported
- ‚úÖ Actionable recommendations provided for method annotation improvements

**Method-Level Annotation Patterns:**

**Source Method Annotation Example:**
```php
class UserService {
    /**
     * @Verified(by="UserServiceTest::testCreateUser")
     * @param array $userData
     * @return User
     */
    public function createUser(array $userData): User {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

**Test Method Annotation Example:**
```php
class UserServiceTest extends TestCase {
    /**
     * @TestedBy(method="UserService::createUser")
     * @covers UserService::createUser
     */
    public function testCreateUser(): void {
        // Test implementation
    }
}
```

**Anti-Patterns to Avoid:**
- ‚ùå Running validation without method-level bidirectional linkage analysis (incomplete validation)
- ‚ùå Validating at class level instead of method level (insufficient granularity)
- ‚ùå Ignoring orphaned methods without corresponding test annotations (quality compromise)
- ‚ùå Single-threaded validation without parallelization (performance issue)
- ‚ùå Generic validation without method-specific PHP optimization (suboptimal)
- ‚ùå Skipping method-level coverage analysis or quality metrics (missed insights)
- ‚ùå No automated method annotation fixing or actionable recommendations (missed improvements)
- ‚ùå Using bash functions instead of Task tool agents (not real parallelism)

**Final Verification:**
Before completing method-level annotation validation:
- Have I spawned all 5 agents using Task tool for true parallel processing?
- Have I discovered and scanned all public source methods for @Verified annotations?
- Have I discovered and scanned all test methods for @TestedBy annotations?
- Are method-to-test-case linkage reports generated with gap analysis?
- Have I identified and reported all orphaned methods without corresponding annotations?
- Are method-level fix recommendations provided with safe mode options?
- Do I have comprehensive monitoring setup for continuous method-level validation?

**Final Commitment:**
- **I will**: Use Task tool for all 5 agent spawning operations with proper parallel execution
- **I will**: Validate all method-level annotations with comprehensive bidirectional linkage analysis
- **I will**: Discover and scan all public source methods for @Verified annotations
- **I will**: Discover and scan all test methods for @TestedBy annotations
- **I will**: Use parallel agents for optimal method-level validation performance
- **I will**: Provide detailed method-to-test-case gap analysis and actionable recommendations
- **I will**: Validate method annotation quality and suggest improvements
- **I will**: Generate comprehensive method-level reports with monitoring capabilities
- **I will NOT**: Skip method-level linkage analysis or quality validation
- **I will NOT**: Ignore orphaned methods or broken method-to-test-case linkages
- **I will NOT**: Use single-threaded validation without parallelization
- **I will NOT**: Use bash functions instead of proper Task tool agents
- **I will NOT**: Provide generic reports without method-specific actionable insights

**REMEMBER:**
This is METHOD-LEVEL ANNOTATION VALIDATION mode - comprehensive method-level annotation analysis with bidirectional linkage validation, quality metrics, and automated fixing using 5 parallel Task tool agents. The goal is to ensure every source method has a corresponding @Verified annotation pointing to a specific test method, and every test method has a corresponding @TestedBy annotation pointing to a specific source method.
