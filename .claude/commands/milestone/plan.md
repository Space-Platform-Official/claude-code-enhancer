# 🔍🔍🔍 CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: MILESTONE PLANNING PHASE! 🔍🔍🔍

**THIS IS NOT IMPLEMENTATION - THIS IS STRATEGIC MILESTONE PLANNING!**

When you run `/milestone/plan`, you are REQUIRED to:

1. **ANALYZE** complete project scope and complexity assessment
2. **DECOMPOSE** project into strategic milestone chunks (2-4 week durations)
3. **ESTIMATE** realistic timelines with dependency mapping
4. **CREATE** milestone directory structure and initial configuration
5. **USE MULTIPLE AGENTS** for comprehensive planning analysis:
   - Spawn one agent for scope analysis and requirements gathering
   - Spawn another for timeline estimation and dependency mapping
   - Spawn more agents for risk assessment and mitigation planning
   - Say: "I'll spawn multiple agents to analyze this project from different planning perspectives"

## 🎯 USE MULTIPLE AGENTS

**MANDATORY AGENT SPAWNING FOR PLANNING COMPLEXITY:**
```
"I'll spawn multiple agents to handle comprehensive milestone planning:
- Scope Agent: Analyze requirements and project complexity
- Timeline Agent: Estimate realistic durations and dependencies  
- Risk Agent: Identify potential blockers and mitigation strategies
- Structure Agent: Design milestone directory structure and templates
- Decomposition Agent: Break down complex goals into manageable milestones"
```

## 🚨 FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS

**NEVER:**
- ❌ Create implementation tasks → NO! Strategic planning only!
- ❌ "Let's start coding first" → NO! Planning before implementation!
- ❌ Skip scope analysis → NO! Full understanding required!
- ❌ Use arbitrary timeline estimates → NO! Research-based planning!
- ❌ Ignore project dependencies → NO! Map all interconnections!
- ❌ "We'll figure it out later" → NO! Comprehensive planning first!

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**
```
1. Project scope analysis → Understand full complexity and requirements
2. IMMEDIATELY spawn agents for parallel planning analysis
3. Strategic milestone decomposition → Break into 2-4 week chunks
4. Timeline estimation with dependencies → Research-based scheduling
5. Create milestone directory structure → Persistent planning framework
6. VERIFY planning completeness and feasibility
```

**YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL:**
- ✅ Complete project scope analyzed and documented
- ✅ Strategic milestones defined with clear boundaries
- ✅ Timeline estimates completed with dependency mapping
- ✅ Risk assessment finished with mitigation strategies
- ✅ Milestone directory structure created with templates
- ✅ Project-specific milestone configuration generated

🛑 **MANDATORY MILESTONE PLANNING CHECK** 🛑
1. Re-read ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md RIGHT NOW
2. Check project requirements and existing documentation  
3. Verify you understand scope requiring strategic planning

Execute comprehensive milestone planning with ZERO tolerance for implementation shortcuts.

**FORBIDDEN SHORTCUT PATTERNS:**
- "Let's create basic milestones" → NO, strategic decomposition required
- "We can plan as we go" → NO, comprehensive planning first
- "Simple timeline is enough" → NO, dependency-aware scheduling needed
- "One milestone template fits all" → NO, project-specific templates required
- "Skip risk assessment for now" → NO, mitigation planning is critical

You are planning milestones for: $ARGUMENTS

Let me ultrathink about the strategic milestone architecture and planning framework.

🚨 **REMEMBER: Strategic planning prevents costly pivots and rework!** 🚨

**Comprehensive Milestone Planning Protocol:**

**Step 0: Project Scope Analysis**
- Analyze complete project requirements and success criteria
- Map functional and non-functional requirements comprehensively
- Identify technical constraints and technology dependencies
- Assess team capabilities and resource availability
- Document stakeholder expectations and delivery deadlines
- Review existing codebase and architectural constraints

**Step 1: Strategic Milestone Decomposition**
- Break complex project into logical milestone boundaries
- Ensure each milestone delivers standalone business value
- Define clear completion criteria and acceptance thresholds
- Map milestone interdependencies and critical path elements
- Validate milestone scope fits 2-4 week execution windows
- Identify milestone-specific success metrics and KPIs

**Step 2: Timeline Estimation and Dependency Mapping**

**Research-Based Estimation Process:**
```
Estimation factors to analyze:
- Historical velocity data from similar projects
- Team experience levels with required technologies
- Complexity multipliers for new/unknown technologies
- Integration complexity with existing systems
- Testing and quality assurance time requirements
- Buffer allocation for unexpected challenges (20-30%)
```

**Dependency Analysis Framework:**
```yaml
dependency_mapping:
  technical_dependencies:
    - external_apis: ["payment-gateway", "auth-service"]
    - infrastructure: ["database-migration", "deployment-pipeline"]
    - third_party: ["design-assets", "content-creation"]
  
  team_dependencies:
    - skill_development: ["react-training", "security-certification"]
    - resource_allocation: ["designer-availability", "devops-support"]
    - review_processes: ["architecture-review", "security-audit"]
  
  business_dependencies:
    - approvals: ["budget-approval", "compliance-review"]
    - external_deliverables: ["client-feedback", "vendor-integration"]
    - regulatory: ["privacy-assessment", "accessibility-compliance"]
```

**Step 3: Milestone Directory Structure Creation**

**Generate Project-Specific Structure:**
```
.milestones/
├── config/
│   ├── milestone-config.yaml     # Project-specific configuration
│   ├── dependencies.yaml         # Cross-milestone dependencies
│   ├── timeline-estimates.yaml   # Scheduling and duration data
│   └── risk-register.yaml        # Risk assessment and mitigation
├── planning/
│   ├── scope-analysis.md          # Detailed project scope breakdown
│   ├── decomposition-strategy.md  # Milestone breakdown rationale
│   ├── timeline-estimation.md     # Estimation methodology and data
│   └── stakeholder-requirements.md # Requirements traceability
├── templates/
│   ├── milestone-template.yaml    # Standard milestone structure
│   ├── task-template.yaml         # Task definition template
│   └── progress-tracking.yaml     # Progress measurement template
└── active/
    ├── milestone-001.yaml         # Ready for implementation
    ├── milestone-002.yaml         # Planned next milestone
    └── dependencies.yaml          # Active dependency tracking
```

**Step 4: Risk Assessment and Mitigation Planning**

**Comprehensive Risk Analysis:**
```yaml
risk_categories:
  technical_risks:
    - complexity_underestimation:
        probability: 0.4
        impact: "high"
        mitigation: "Add 30% buffer, prototype critical components"
    - integration_challenges:
        probability: 0.3
        impact: "medium"
        mitigation: "Early integration testing, API contracts"
  
  resource_risks:
    - team_availability:
        probability: 0.2
        impact: "high"
        mitigation: "Cross-training, knowledge documentation"
    - skill_gaps:
        probability: 0.3
        impact: "medium"
        mitigation: "Training allocation, expert consultation"
  
  external_risks:
    - dependency_delays:
        probability: 0.3
        impact: "high"
        mitigation: "Alternative solutions, early coordination"
    - requirement_changes:
        probability: 0.4
        impact: "medium"
        mitigation: "Change control process, stakeholder alignment"
```

**Step 5: Project-Specific Template Generation**

**Milestone Template Customization:**
```yaml
# Generated based on project type and requirements
milestone_template:
  metadata:
    project_type: "${PROJECT_TYPE}"  # frontend, backend, fullstack, mobile
    methodology: "${METHODOLOGY}"    # agile, waterfall, hybrid
    team_size: "${TEAM_SIZE}"
    
  structure:
    objectives:
      - primary_goal: "Clear business objective"
      - success_criteria: ["Measurable outcome 1", "Measurable outcome 2"]
      - business_value: "Tangible value delivered"
    
    scope:
      included: ["Feature A", "Component B", "Integration C"]
      excluded: ["Future enhancement", "Nice-to-have feature"]
      assumptions: ["Dependency available", "Resource allocated"]
    
    timeline:
      estimated_duration: "${DURATION_WEEKS} weeks"
      critical_path_items: ["Blocking task 1", "Blocking task 2"]
      buffer_percentage: "${BUFFER_PERCENT}%"
      
    dependencies:
      prerequisite_milestones: []
      external_dependencies: []
      shared_resources: []
```

**Step 6: Multi-Agent Planning Execution**

**Agent Spawning Strategy for Complex Projects:**
```
"I'll coordinate specialized planning agents for comprehensive analysis:

1. **Scope Analysis Agent**: 'Analyze project requirements and decompose into logical boundaries'
2. **Timeline Estimation Agent**: 'Research historical data and estimate realistic durations'
3. **Risk Assessment Agent**: 'Identify potential blockers and create mitigation strategies'
4. **Dependency Mapping Agent**: 'Map technical, team, and business dependencies'
5. **Template Generation Agent**: 'Create project-specific templates and configurations'

Each agent will provide detailed analysis for strategic milestone planning."
```

**Planning Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Project scope fully analyzed and documented
- [ ] Milestones provide standalone business value
- [ ] Timeline estimates based on research and historical data
- [ ] Dependencies mapped across technical, team, and business domains
- [ ] Risk assessment completed with specific mitigation strategies
- [ ] Milestone directory structure created with project-specific templates
- [ ] Configuration files generated with appropriate project parameters
- [ ] Planning documentation provides clear implementation roadmap

**Milestone Planning Anti-Patterns:**
- ❌ Creating implementation tasks during planning phase
- ❌ Estimating timelines without historical research
- ❌ Ignoring external dependencies and constraints
- ❌ Using generic templates without project customization
- ❌ Skipping risk assessment for "simple" projects
- ❌ Planning milestones longer than 4 weeks (too complex)
- ❌ Creating milestones without clear business value

**Final Planning Verification:**
Before completing milestone planning:
- Have I analyzed the complete project scope?
- Are milestone boundaries logical and valuable?
- Are timeline estimates research-based and realistic?
- Have I mapped all critical dependencies?
- Are risk assessments comprehensive with mitigation plans?
- Is the directory structure project-appropriate?
- Do templates match project requirements?

**Final Commitment:**
- **I will**: Execute comprehensive scope analysis before decomposition
- **I will**: Create strategic milestones with clear business value
- **I will**: Use research-based timeline estimation methodology
- **I will**: Map dependencies across all domains comprehensively
- **I will**: Generate project-specific templates and configurations
- **I will NOT**: Create implementation tasks during planning
- **I will NOT**: Use arbitrary timeline estimates
- **I will NOT**: Skip risk assessment or dependency mapping

**REMEMBER:**
This is MILESTONE PLANNING mode - strategic analysis, decomposition, and preparation for execution. The goal is to create a comprehensive roadmap that enables successful project delivery through well-planned milestone execution.
