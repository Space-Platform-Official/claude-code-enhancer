## Getting Started

### Basic Milestone Management

#### Creating Your First Milestone
```bash
# Simple milestone creation
/milestone/plan "Implement user authentication system"
```

This will:
1. Analyze the scope and complexity
2. Break down into manageable tasks
3. Create a milestone file in `.milestones/active/`
4. Set up the appropriate storage backend (file-based for small projects)

#### Executing a Milestone
```bash
# Start milestone execution with multi-agent coordination
/milestone/execute milestone-001
```

The system automatically:
- Deploys execution agents (Task Executor, Progress Monitor, Git Integration)
- Starts real-time progress tracking
- Manages session state for interruption recovery
- Integrates with Git for repository consistency

#### Monitoring Progress
```bash
# View comprehensive status dashboard
/milestone/update
```

This provides:
- Overall project progress
- Individual milestone status
- Agent coordination status
- Performance metrics
- Risk alerts and recommendations

### Working with Different Project Scales

#### Small Projects (1-20 milestones)
For small projects, the system uses a simple file-based approach:

```yaml
# .milestones/active/milestone-001.yaml
id: milestone-001
title: "User Authentication System"
status: "planned"
tasks:
  - id: task-001
    title: "Design authentication flow"
    status: "pending"
  - id: task-002
    title: "Implement login API"
    status: "pending"
dependencies:
  requires: []
progress:
  percentage: 0
  tasks_completed: 0
```

```

### Dependency Management

#### Best Practices
1. **Clear Dependencies**: Explicitly define prerequisite milestones
2. **Parallel Opportunities**: Identify tasks that can run concurrently
3. **Critical Path**: Understand which milestones are blocking others
4. **Regular Validation**: Use `/milestone/update --dependencies` to check status

#### Dependency Examples
```yaml
# Simple dependency
dependencies:
  requires: ["milestone-001"]

# Complex dependency with conditions
dependencies:
  requires: ["milestone-001", "milestone-002"]
  conditions:
    - "database_schema_complete"
    - "api_specification_approved"
```

### Performance Optimization

#### For Different Scales

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Scale Detection Problems
```bash
# If the system doesn't scale appropriately:
# Check current scale detection
cat .milestones/config/scale-detection.yaml

# Force specific scale mode
echo "scale_override: database" >> .milestones/config/milestone-config.yaml
```

#### Agent Coordination Issues
```bash
# Check agent status
/milestone/update --agents

# Restart failed agents
/milestone/execute milestone-001 --restart-agents

# Manual agent cleanup
rm -rf .milestones/sessions/agents/
```

#### Session Recovery Problems
```bash
# List available sessions
ls .milestones/sessions/

# Resume from specific session
/milestone/execute milestone-001 --resume-session session-id

# Reset session state
rm .milestones/sessions/session-current.yaml
```

### Performance Issues

#### Slow Operations
1. **Check Scale**: Verify appropriate backend is selected
2. **Database Optimization**: For database mode, check indexes
3. **Agent Limit**: Reduce concurrent agents if system is overloaded
4. **Cleanup**: Archive old milestones to reduce data volume

#### Memory Usage
```bash
# Monitor system resource usage
/milestone/update --system-health

# Cleanup temporary files
find .milestones/temp/ -mtime +7 -delete

# Optimize database (if using database mode)
/milestone/update --optimize-database
```
