# üîçüîçüîç CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: COMPREHENSIVE CODE REVIEW! üîçüîçüîç

**THIS IS NOT A SUPERFICIAL SCAN - THIS IS A THOROUGH REVIEW TASK!**

When you run `/review`, you are REQUIRED to:

1. **ANALYZE** all changes against team standards comprehensively
2. **EVALUATE** performance, security, and quality thoroughly
3. **VERIFY** test coverage for all changes
4. **PROVIDE** actionable improvement suggestions
5. **USE MULTIPLE AGENTS** for parallel review:
   - Spawn one agent for performance analysis
   - Spawn another for security audit
   - Spawn more agents for different modules/files
   - Say: "I'll spawn multiple agents to review different aspects in parallel"
6. **DO NOT STOP** until:
   - ‚úÖ ALL code meets quality standards
   - ‚úÖ ALL security vulnerabilities addressed
   - ‚úÖ ALL performance issues identified
   - ‚úÖ COMPLETE review documentation provided

**FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS:**
- ‚ùå "Code looks good overall" ‚Üí NO! Deep dive into details!
- ‚ùå "No obvious issues" ‚Üí NO! Find the non-obvious ones!
- ‚ùå "Tests seem adequate" ‚Üí NO! Verify coverage and quality!
- ‚ùå Surface-level review ‚Üí NO! Comprehensive analysis required!

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**
```
1. Analyze changes ‚Üí Identify all modifications
2. IMMEDIATELY spawn agents for parallel review
3. Deep dive into each area ‚Üí Find all issues
4. Consolidate findings ‚Üí Create actionable report
5. REPEAT for any missed areas
```

**YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL:**
- All code paths have been analyzed
- All security implications assessed
- All performance impacts evaluated
- All test coverage verified
- Complete review report generated

üõë **MANDATORY PRE-REVIEW CHECK** üõë
1. Re-read ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md RIGHT NOW
2. Check current TODO.md status
3. Verify you understand the scope of changes

Execute comprehensive code review with ZERO tolerance for shortcuts.

**FORBIDDEN EXCUSE PATTERNS:**
- "This looks fine at first glance" ‚Üí NO, deep analysis required
- "Most of the code is straightforward" ‚Üí NO, review ALL code
- "The tests should catch issues" ‚Üí NO, review the tests too
- "It follows existing patterns" ‚Üí NO, verify those patterns are correct
- "The author is experienced" ‚Üí NO, everyone's code needs review

Let me ultrathink about performing a comprehensive review of these changes.

üö® **REMEMBER: Every line matters for code quality!** üö®

**Comprehensive Code Review Protocol:**

**Step 0: Change Analysis**
$ARGUMENTS

- Understand the scope and nature of all changes
- Identify affected systems and dependencies
- Review commit messages and PR descriptions
- Check for any breaking changes or migrations

**Step 1: Architecture Review**
- Evaluate design decisions and patterns used
- Check for adherence to SOLID principles
- Verify proper separation of concerns
- Assess maintainability and extensibility
- Review API design and interface contracts

**Step 2: Security Analysis**
- [ ] Input validation on all external data
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (prepared statements)
- [ ] XSS prevention in web interfaces
- [ ] Authentication and authorization checks
- [ ] Secrets management (no hardcoded credentials)
- [ ] Rate limiting and DoS protection
- [ ] Data sanitization and encoding
- [ ] Privilege escalation prevention
- [ ] HTTPS enforcement where applicable
- [ ] Dependency vulnerability scan

**Step 3: Performance Evaluation**
- [ ] Algorithm complexity analysis
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] Memory usage patterns
- [ ] CPU-intensive operations review
- [ ] Network I/O efficiency
- [ ] Caching strategy evaluation
- [ ] Concurrency and thread safety
- [ ] Resource leak prevention
- [ ] Scalability considerations

**For Go Code Specifically:**
- [ ] No interface{} or any{} usage
- [ ] Proper error handling and wrapping
- [ ] Goroutine lifecycle management
- [ ] Channel usage patterns
- [ ] Context propagation
- [ ] Race condition prevention
- [ ] Memory allocation patterns
- [ ] GC pressure considerations

**Step 4: Code Quality Assessment**
- [ ] Readability and maintainability
- [ ] Naming conventions and clarity
- [ ] Function/method size and complexity
- [ ] Code duplication analysis
- [ ] Comment quality and necessity
- [ ] Error handling completeness
- [ ] Logging and observability
- [ ] Configuration management
- [ ] Documentation completeness

**Step 5: Test Coverage Verification**
- [ ] Unit test completeness for business logic
- [ ] Integration test coverage
- [ ] Edge case handling in tests
- [ ] Error path testing
- [ ] Mock usage appropriateness
- [ ] Test data management
- [ ] Test performance and flakiness
- [ ] End-to-end test coverage
- [ ] Load/stress test considerations

**Step 6: Dependencies and Integration**
- [ ] New dependency justification
- [ ] Version compatibility checks
- [ ] License compliance
- [ ] Security vulnerability in dependencies
- [ ] Breaking changes in updates
- [ ] Integration point validation
- [ ] API contract compliance
- [ ] Backward compatibility preservation

**Parallel Review Strategy:**
When conducting the review, spawn multiple agents:
1. **Security Agent**: Focus on security implications and vulnerabilities
2. **Performance Agent**: Analyze performance characteristics and bottlenecks
3. **Testing Agent**: Evaluate test coverage and quality
4. **Architecture Agent**: Review design patterns and code organization
5. **Documentation Agent**: Assess documentation and code clarity

**Review Report Structure:**

**Critical Issues (Must Fix):**
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance bottlenecks
- Breaking changes
- Test coverage gaps

**Important Issues (Should Fix):**
- Code quality improvements
- Architecture concerns
- Documentation gaps
- Minor performance optimizations

**Suggestions (Nice to Have):**
- Refactoring opportunities
- Additional tests
- Code style improvements
- Future considerations

**Actionable Recommendations:**
For each issue identified, provide:
- Clear description of the problem
- Why it matters (impact)
- Specific fix recommendations
- Code examples where helpful
- Priority level (Critical/Important/Suggestion)

**Final Verification:**
The review is complete when:
‚úì All code changes thoroughly analyzed
‚úì Security implications fully assessed
‚úì Performance impact evaluated
‚úì Test coverage verified and documented
‚úì All findings documented with actionable recommendations
‚úì Priority levels assigned to all issues
‚úì No stone left unturned

**Final Commitment:**
I will now execute EVERY review step listed above and provide comprehensive analysis. I will:
- ‚úÖ Analyze every line of changed code
- ‚úÖ SPAWN MULTIPLE AGENTS for parallel review aspects
- ‚úÖ Identify all security, performance, and quality issues
- ‚úÖ Provide detailed, actionable recommendations
- ‚úÖ Create a complete review report

I will NOT:
- ‚ùå Perform superficial review
- ‚ùå Skip any review categories
- ‚ùå Accept "good enough" code
- ‚ùå Miss security or performance issues
- ‚ùå Provide vague feedback
- ‚ùå Leave any aspect unreviewed

**REMEMBER: This is a COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW task, not a quick scan!**

The review is complete ONLY when every aspect shows thorough analysis.

**Executing comprehensive code review NOW...**
