# üîçüîçüîç MANDATORY FOCUSED REASONING PROTOCOL üîçüîçüîç

**THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE RESPONSE - THIS IS A FOCUSED REASONING TASK!**

When you run `/think`, you are REQUIRED to:

1. **ASSESS** the problem complexity and choose appropriate reasoning depth
2. **ANALYZE** the core challenge without forcing unnecessary complexity
3. **REASON** through the solution space with focused clarity
4. **DELIVER** actionable insights without over-engineering
5. **USE AGENTS STRATEGICALLY** when complexity justifies it:
   - Spawn agents for parallel analysis when problem has distinct components
   - Use single-agent reasoning for focused problems
   - Say: "I'll spawn agents to explore different aspects" only when beneficial

**FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS:**
- ‚ùå "Must provide 3 options regardless" ‚Üí NO! Provide optimal solution clarity!
- ‚ùå "Force complex analysis for simple problems" ‚Üí NO! Match depth to complexity!
- ‚ùå "Rigid protocol regardless of context" ‚Üí NO! Adaptive reasoning required!
- ‚ùå "Over-engineer when simplicity works" ‚Üí NO! Focused solutions preferred!

**ADAPTIVE REASONING WORKFLOW:**
```
1. Problem assessment ‚Üí Determine reasoning depth needed
2. Core analysis ‚Üí Focus on essential challenges
3. Solution reasoning ‚Üí Clear path to resolution
4. Validation check ‚Üí Ensure approach matches complexity
5. Delivery ‚Üí Actionable insights without over-engineering
```

**YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL:**
- ‚úÖ Problem complexity properly assessed
- ‚úÖ Reasoning depth matches actual need
- ‚úÖ Solution path is clear and actionable
- ‚úÖ No unnecessary complexity introduced
- ‚úÖ Focused insights delivered effectively

üõë **MANDATORY FOCUSED REASONING PROTOCOL** üõë
1. Re-read ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md RIGHT NOW
2. Check current TODO.md status
3. Assess problem complexity honestly

Execute focused reasoning with ZERO tolerance for over-engineering.

**FORBIDDEN SHORTCUT PATTERNS:**
- "Always use maximum analysis depth" ‚Üí NO, match depth to need
- "Force multi-agent spawning" ‚Üí NO, use when beneficial
- "Provide multiple options by default" ‚Üí NO, focus on optimal path
- "Apply rigid methodology" ‚Üí NO, adapt to problem type

You are reasoning about: $ARGUMENTS

Let me think deeply about this challenge with appropriate focus.

üö® **REMEMBER: Clarity and focus over complexity!** üö®

**Adaptive Reasoning Protocol:**

**Step 0: Problem Complexity Assessment**
Evaluate the challenge to determine reasoning approach:
- Simple problems: Direct analysis with clear solution path
- Medium problems: Structured reasoning with key considerations
- Complex problems: Comprehensive analysis with strategic agent deployment
- Adaptive depth: Match reasoning intensity to actual problem complexity

**Step 1: Core Challenge Analysis**
Focus on the essential aspects without unnecessary elaboration:
- [ ] Identify the primary challenge or decision point
- [ ] Understand constraints and requirements clearly
- [ ] Recognize what actually needs to be solved (vs. nice-to-have)
- [ ] Assess available information and knowledge gaps

**Step 2: Strategic Agent Deployment**
Deploy agents only when complexity justifies parallel analysis:

**For Simple Problems (Direct Reasoning):**
- Single-agent focused analysis
- Clear solution path identification
- Direct actionable recommendations

**For Medium Problems (Structured Analysis):**
- Consider key aspects systematically
- May use 1-2 agents for distinct components
- Focus on practical solutions

**For Complex Problems (Comprehensive Reasoning):**
- Strategic multi-agent deployment for parallel exploration
- "I'll spawn agents to analyze different critical aspects..."
- Coordinate insights for comprehensive understanding

**Agent Deployment Decision Tree:**
```
Problem Type ‚Üí Agent Strategy
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Simple: Direct reasoning, no agents needed
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Medium: 1-2 agents for distinct aspects if beneficial
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Complex: Strategic multi-agent deployment for parallel analysis
```

**Step 3: Solution Space Exploration**
Explore solutions with focus and clarity:
- [ ] Identify the most promising approach first
- [ ] Consider key alternatives only if they offer significant advantages
- [ ] Focus on implementable solutions over theoretical possibilities
- [ ] Assess practical constraints and trade-offs

**Step 4: Insight Synthesis and Validation**
Combine analysis into actionable insights:
- [ ] Synthesize findings into clear recommendations
- [ ] Validate that solution matches problem complexity
- [ ] Ensure recommendations are actionable and specific
- [ ] Check that analysis depth was appropriate

**Reasoning Complexity Guidelines:**

**Simple Problem Indicators:**
- Single domain or area of concern
- Clear requirements and constraints
- Obvious solution approach exists
- Minimal interdependencies

**Medium Problem Indicators:**
- Multiple considerations but manageable scope
- Some uncertainty in requirements or approach
- Several viable solutions to evaluate
- Moderate interdependencies

**Complex Problem Indicators:**
- Multiple domains or stakeholder perspectives
- Significant uncertainty or competing priorities
- Architectural or strategic implications
- High interdependencies and system impact

**Focused Reasoning Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Problem complexity appropriately assessed
- [ ] Reasoning depth matches actual need
- [ ] Analysis focuses on essential aspects
- [ ] Solutions are practical and actionable
- [ ] No unnecessary complexity introduced
- [ ] Insights are clear and implementable
- [ ] Agent usage was strategic and beneficial

**Anti-patterns for Focused Reasoning (FORBIDDEN):**
- ‚ùå "Default to maximum complexity analysis" ‚Üí NO, assess and adapt
- ‚ùå "Always provide multiple solution options" ‚Üí NO, focus on optimal path
- ‚ùå "Force comprehensive exploration for simple problems" ‚Üí NO, match depth
- ‚ùå "Use agents because the command allows it" ‚Üí NO, use strategically
- ‚ùå "Apply same methodology regardless of context" ‚Üí NO, adapt approach

**Final Focused Reasoning Verification:**
The reasoning is complete when:
‚úì Problem has been assessed with appropriate depth
‚úì Core challenges are clearly understood
‚úì Solution path is actionable and focused
‚úì Complexity level matches actual problem needs
‚úì Insights are clear and implementable
‚úì No over-engineering or unnecessary elaboration

**Final Focused Reasoning Commitment:**
I will now execute focused reasoning that matches the problem complexity. I will:
- ‚úÖ Assess problem complexity honestly before proceeding
- ‚úÖ Use appropriate reasoning depth for the actual challenge
- ‚úÖ Deploy agents strategically only when beneficial
- ‚úÖ Focus on actionable solutions over theoretical exploration
- ‚úÖ Deliver clear insights without over-engineering

I will NOT:
- ‚ùå Force complex analysis for simple problems
- ‚ùå Default to maximum methodology regardless of need
- ‚ùå Over-engineer solutions when simplicity works
- ‚ùå Use agents unnecessarily or rigidly follow complex protocols
- ‚ùå Provide excessive options when focus is needed

**REMEMBER: This is a FOCUSED REASONING task, not rigid analysis!**

The reasoning is ready ONLY when it provides clear, actionable insights appropriate to the actual problem complexity.

**Executing adaptive focused reasoning NOW...**
