# Progressive Upgrade Paths for Quick-Start Templates

## Progressive Complexity Introduction

Quick-start templates provide clear upgrade paths to advanced features when users are ready.

### Core Principles

- **User-driven progression**: Users choose when to add complexity
- **Zero data loss**: All progress preserved during upgrades
- **Gradual introduction**: Features added one at a time, not all at once
- **Reversible**: Users can step back if they find features too complex

### Upgrade Levels

```yaml
upgrade_levels:
  level_0_quickstart:
    name: "Quick-Start (Current)"
    complexity: "minimal"
    features: ["basic_tasks", "simple_progress", "clear_outcomes"]
    target_users: ["new_users", "simple_projects"]
    
  level_1_enhanced:
    name: "Enhanced Features"
    complexity: "moderate"
    features: ["kiro_workflow", "team_coordination", "advanced_dependencies"]
    target_users: ["experienced_users", "team_projects"]
    
  level_2_full:
    name: "Full Milestone System"
    complexity: "comprehensive"
    features: ["all_milestone_features", "enterprise_dashboard", "multi_agent"]
    target_users: ["enterprise_teams", "complex_projects"]
```

### Upgrade Triggers

```bash
# Automatic upgrade suggestions based on user behavior
check_upgrade_readiness() {
    local milestone_path="$1"
    local user_stats_file="$milestone_path/../user-stats.yaml"
    
    # Check completion rate
    local completed_milestones=$(yaml_get "$user_stats_file" "stats.completed_milestones")
    local success_rate=$(yaml_get "$user_stats_file" "stats.success_rate")
    
    # Check feature requests
    local advanced_feature_requests=$(yaml_get "$user_stats_file" "stats.advanced_feature_requests")
    
    # Check team usage
    local team_usage=$(yaml_get "$user_stats_file" "stats.team_usage")
    
    # Determine upgrade suggestions
    suggest_upgrades "$completed_milestones" "$success_rate" "$advanced_feature_requests" "$team_usage"
}

# Upgrade suggestion logic
suggest_upgrades() {
    local completed="$1"
    local success_rate="$2"
    local feature_requests="$3"
    local team_usage="$4"
    
    # Suggest enhanced features after 3 successful milestones
    if [ "$completed" -ge 3 ] && [ "$success_rate" -ge 80 ]; then
        suggest_enhanced_upgrade
    fi
    
    # Suggest team features if team usage detected
    if [ "$team_usage" -eq 1 ]; then
        suggest_team_upgrade
    fi
    
    # Suggest full system if advanced features requested multiple times
    if [ "$feature_requests" -ge 3 ]; then
        suggest_full_upgrade
    fi
}
```
