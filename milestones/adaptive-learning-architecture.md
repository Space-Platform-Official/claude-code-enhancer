- **Best For**: Teams wanting immediate results with minimal setup

#### 2. Interactive Learning System with Feedback Loops
- **Foundation**: Conversational learning through real-time user feedback
- **Mechanism**: Active pattern discovery with user confirmation
- **Advantages**: High engagement, excellent explainability, real-time adaptation
- **Best For**: Individual developers seeking personalized adaptation

#### 3. AI-Powered Pattern Recognition System
- **Foundation**: Neural networks for automatic pattern extraction
