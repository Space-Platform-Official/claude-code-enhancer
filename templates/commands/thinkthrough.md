# üîç‚ö°üö® CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: COMPREHENSIVE THINK-THROUGH MODE ENGAGED

**THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE ANALYSIS OR IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION - THIS IS A COMPREHENSIVE THINK-THROUGH TASK!**

When you run `/thinkthrough`, you are REQUIRED to:

1. **ANALYZE** the problem comprehensively with deep reasoning (ultrathink-level depth)
2. **EVALUATE** multiple solution approaches and automatically select the optimal one
3. **REQUEST** explicit user permission before any implementation
4. **IMPLEMENT** the approved solution with full execution capability
5. **USE MULTIPLE AGENTS STRATEGICALLY** for parallel analysis and execution:
   - Spawn agents for different aspects of problem analysis
   - Deploy evaluation agents for solution comparison
   - Use implementation agents for parallel execution after approval
   - Say: "I'll spawn agents to think through this comprehensively before seeking permission"

**FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS:**
- ‚ùå "Jump to quick solution without deep analysis" ‚Üí NO! Comprehensive reasoning required!
- ‚ùå "Present multiple options to user" ‚Üí NO! Auto-select optimal solution!
- ‚ùå "Implement without explicit permission" ‚Üí NO! Permission gate is mandatory!
- ‚ùå "Skip analysis depth for simple problems" ‚Üí NO! Always think through thoroughly!
- ‚ùå "Force user to choose between options" ‚Üí NO! Provide single optimal recommendation!

**MANDATORY THINK-THROUGH WORKFLOW:**
```
1. THINK_MODE: Deep comprehensive analysis with agent deployment
2. THROUGH_MODE: Solution evaluation and automatic optimal selection
3. ASK_MODE: Permission request with clear implementation scope
4. EXECUTE_MODE: Full implementation after user approval
```

**YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL:**
- ‚úÖ Problem analyzed comprehensively from multiple angles
- ‚úÖ Multiple solutions evaluated with automatic optimal selection
- ‚úÖ Single best solution identified with clear justification
- ‚úÖ User permission explicitly requested and granted
- ‚úÖ Implementation completed successfully with validation

---

üõë **MANDATORY THINK-THROUGH PROTOCOL** üõë
1. Re-read ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md RIGHT NOW
2. Check current TODO.md status
3. Engage deep reasoning without implementation pressure
4. Auto-select optimal solution based on comprehensive evaluation
5. Request explicit permission before any code changes

Execute comprehensive think-through analysis with ZERO tolerance for shortcuts.

**FORBIDDEN SHORTCUT PATTERNS:**
- "Skip deep analysis for obvious solutions" ‚Üí NO, always think through completely
- "Present multiple options by default" ‚Üí NO, auto-select the optimal approach
- "Assume permission for simple changes" ‚Üí NO, always request explicit approval
- "Rush to implementation" ‚Üí NO, thorough analysis first

You are thinking through: $ARGUMENTS

Let me think through this challenge comprehensively with automatic solution selection and permission control.

üö® **REMEMBER: Comprehensive reasoning, optimal selection, permission gate, then execution!** üö®
