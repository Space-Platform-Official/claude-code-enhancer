├── Monitoring: Enhanced error tracking for authentication flows
└── Documentation: Added troubleshooting guide for auth issues

TEAM LEARNINGS:
├── Always test complete user workflows, not just individual functions
├── Database transactions need explicit testing with rollback scenarios
├── Authentication changes require extra scrutiny and testing
└── User communication during fixes builds trust and understanding
