# 🎯 Milestone System - Complete Guide

Welcome to the Enhanced Hybrid Milestone Architecture - intelligent project management that automatically scales from personal projects to enterprise teams.

## 🚀 Quick Start (2 minutes)

Get started with milestone management immediately:

```bash
# 1. Plan your project
/milestone/plan "Build user authentication system"

# 2. Start working  
/milestone/execute

# 3. Check progress
/milestone/status

# 4. Archive when done
/milestone/archive milestone-001
```

That's it! The system automatically handles complexity, scaling, and workflow management.

## 🏗️ How It Works

### **Automatic Intelligence**
The system automatically adapts to your project scale:

- **👤 Personal Projects** (1-25 milestones): Simple file storage, clean text output
- **👥 Team Projects** (25-100 milestones): Rich UI, coordination features  
- **🏢 Enterprise Projects** (100+ milestones): Web dashboards, analytics

### **Progressive Workflows**
Choose your workflow complexity:

- **Basic**: Plan → Execute → Archive
- **Structured**: Plan → Execute with Kiro phases → Review → Archive
- **Enterprise**: Full approval workflows, team coordination, analytics

## 📋 Essential Commands

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `/milestone/plan` | Break down projects into milestones | `/milestone/plan "Build API"` |
| `/milestone/execute` | Work on milestone tasks | `/milestone/execute milestone-001` |
| `/milestone/status` | Check progress and health | `/milestone/status --dashboard` |
| `/milestone/review` | Approve workflow deliverables | `/milestone/review --pending` |
| `/milestone/update` | Modify milestone details | `/milestone/update milestone-001 --status completed` |
| `/milestone/archive` | Clean up completed work | `/milestone/archive --all-completed` |

## 🔄 Complete Workflow Examples

### **Personal Project** (Simple)
```bash
# Plan a personal website
/milestone/plan "Personal portfolio website"
# → Creates milestone with simple structure

# Check what to do
/milestone/status
# → Shows: "Portfolio Website (0% complete) - 4 tasks pending"

# Start working
/milestone/execute
# → Guides through tasks with simple progress tracking

# Archive when done
/milestone/archive milestone-001
```

### **Team Project** (Structured)
```bash
# Plan team collaboration tool
/milestone/plan "Team messaging app with notifications"
# → Creates milestone with Kiro workflow enabled

# Execute with structured workflow
/milestone/execute --kiro-enabled
# → Starts design phase, creates architecture deliverables

# Review deliverables (as team lead)
/milestone/review --pending
# → Shows: "Design phase pending approval for messaging-app"

/milestone/review milestone-001 task-001 --phase design --approve
# → Approves design, unlocks spec phase

# Continue execution
/milestone/execute milestone-001
# → Progresses through spec → task → execute phases

# Team status check
/milestone/status --team-view
# → Shows team utilization, progress, blockers
```

### **Enterprise Project** (Full Features)
```bash
# Plan enterprise CRM system
/milestone/plan "Customer relationship management platform"
# → Creates comprehensive milestone structure

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### **Kiro Workflow Integration**

Structured development phases with approval gates:

```
Design Phase → Spec Phase → Task Phase → Execute Phase
     ↓             ↓            ↓            ↓
Architecture   Technical    Implementation  Working
Planning       Specification Breakdown      Code
```

**How to use:**
```bash
# Enable for complex tasks
/milestone/execute --kiro-enabled

# Review phase deliverables
/milestone/review milestone-001 task-001 --phase design
# → Interactive review interface with approve/reject options

# Track phase progression
/milestone/status milestone-001
# → Shows current phase and completion status
```

### **Automatic System Scaling**

The system automatically optimizes based on your project:

**File Backend** (1-25 milestones):
- YAML file storage
- Simple text interface
- Fast, lightweight operations

**Hybrid Backend** (25-100 milestones):
- YAML files + SQLite index
- Rich terminal interface
- Team coordination features

**Database Backend** (100+ milestones):
- Full SQLite database
- Web dashboard interface
- Enterprise analytics and reporting

### **Zero-Downtime Migrations**

System automatically upgrades without interrupting your work:
- Full backup before any transition
- Seamless data migration
- Automatic rollback if issues occur
- No user intervention required

## 🧪 Verify It's Working

### Quick Health Check
```bash
# Basic system validation
/milestone/status --health
# → Should show all green checkmarks ✅

# Check current scale and features
/milestone/status --scale-info
# → Shows: "Backend: file, UI: simple, Features: basic"
```

### Full System Test
```bash
# Test scaling behavior
for i in {1..30}; do
    /milestone/plan "Test milestone $i"
done

/milestone/status --scale-info
# → Should show: "Backend: hybrid" (automatically upgraded)

# Verify migration integrity
/milestone/status --validate-storage
# → All milestones should be accessible
```

### Component Testing
```bash
# Test Kiro workflow
/milestone/plan "Test Kiro workflow" --enable-kiro
/milestone/execute --kiro-enabled
/milestone/review --pending

# Test UI adaptation
/milestone/status --ui-info
/milestone/status --refresh-ui
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

## 🎯 Best Practices

### **Project Planning**
1. **Start with `/milestone/plan`** - Let the system decompose complexity
2. **Use descriptive names** - "Build user auth with OAuth and JWT"
3. **Enable Kiro for complex tasks** - Structured workflows prevent issues
4. **Regular status checks** - Daily `/milestone/status` keeps projects on track

### **Team Collaboration**
1. **Enable reviews early** - `/milestone/review --pending` in daily standups
2. **Use team views** - `/milestone/status --team-view` for coordination
3. **Archive regularly** - Keep active milestone count manageable
4. **Trust automatic scaling** - Don't force configurations

### **Enterprise Usage**
1. **Dashboard monitoring** - `/milestone/status --dashboard` for stakeholders
2. **Executive reporting** - Regular progress reports for leadership
3. **Risk management** - Monitor `/milestone/status --risk-assessment`
4. **Performance tracking** - Use built-in analytics for optimization
