# üìäüìäüìä CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: MILESTONE STATUS AND MONITORING MODE ENGAGED üìäüìäüìä

**THIS IS NOT A PLANNING OR EXECUTION TASK - THIS IS COMPREHENSIVE STATUS MONITORING AND DASHBOARD GENERATION!**

When you run `/milestone/update`, you are REQUIRED to:

1. **MONITOR** - Generate real-time progress dashboards across all active milestones
2. **AGGREGATE** - Collect and synthesize status data from multiple milestone sources
3. **ANALYZE** - Calculate performance metrics, bottlenecks, and trend analysis
4. **SYNC** - Update session context and resolve state conflicts across milestones
5. **DETECT** - Identify cross-milestone dependencies and potential blockers
6. **REPORT** - Generate stakeholder-ready status reports with actionable insights
7. **RECOMMEND** - Provide data-driven recommendations for optimization

## üéØ USE MULTIPLE AGENTS FOR COMPREHENSIVE STATUS ANALYSIS

**MANDATORY AGENT SPAWNING FOR STATUS MONITORING:**
```
"I'll spawn multiple monitoring agents to analyze milestone status comprehensively:
- Dashboard Generation Agent: Create real-time visual progress dashboards
- Metrics Analysis Agent: Calculate performance indicators and efficiency ratios
- Cross-Milestone Agent: Analyze dependencies and coordination across milestones
- Session Context Agent: Update context state and resolve synchronization conflicts
- Conflict Detection Agent: Identify blockers, risks, and resolution paths
- Reporting Agent: Generate stakeholder reports with actionable insights"
```

## üö® FORBIDDEN BEHAVIORS

**NEVER:**
- ‚ùå Generate static status without real-time data ‚Üí NO! Live monitoring required!
- ‚ùå Report on single milestone in isolation ‚Üí NO! Cross-milestone analysis essential!
- ‚ùå Skip performance metrics calculation ‚Üí NO! Data-driven insights required!
- ‚ùå Ignore session context synchronization ‚Üí NO! State consistency critical!
- ‚ùå Provide status without actionable recommendations ‚Üí NO! Insights must be actionable!
- ‚ùå Skip conflict detection and resolution ‚Üí NO! Proactive issue management required!

**MANDATORY STATUS WORKFLOW:**
```
1. Data collection ‚Üí Gather status from all active milestone sources
2. IMMEDIATELY spawn monitoring agents for parallel status analysis
3. Generate dashboards ‚Üí Create real-time visual progress representations
4. Calculate metrics ‚Üí Performance indicators, efficiency, and trend analysis
5. Sync context ‚Üí Update session state and resolve conflicts
6. Detect blockers ‚Üí Identify cross-milestone dependencies and risks
7. VERIFY status accuracy and provide actionable recommendations
```

**YOU ARE NOT DONE UNTIL:**
- ‚úÖ Real-time dashboards generated for all active milestones
- ‚úÖ Performance metrics calculated with trend analysis
- ‚úÖ Cross-milestone dependencies analyzed and visualized
- ‚úÖ Session context synchronized and conflicts resolved
- ‚úÖ Blockers identified with resolution recommendations

üõë **MANDATORY STATUS MONITORING CHECK** üõë
1. Re-read ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md RIGHT NOW
2. Load active milestone context from _shared/context.md and _shared/state.md
3. Verify you're implementing comprehensive monitoring, not basic status checks

Execute comprehensive milestone status monitoring with ZERO tolerance for superficial reporting.

**FORBIDDEN MINIMAL PATTERNS:**
- "Milestone X is 60% complete" ‚Üí NO, comprehensive analytics required
- "Status looks good" ‚Üí NO, data-driven insights with metrics needed
- "No blockers detected" ‚Üí NO, proactive analysis across dependencies required
- "Simple progress update" ‚Üí NO, dashboard generation and recommendations essential
- "Quick status check" ‚Üí NO, comprehensive monitoring protocol required

You are monitoring milestones for: $ARGUMENTS

```

**Step 2: Performance Metrics and Analytics Implementation**

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of milestones delivered on time
- **Efficiency Ratio**: Actual vs estimated effort across milestones
- **Velocity Trending**: Milestone completion rate over time periods
- **Blocker Impact**: Average resolution time and cascade effects
- **Resource Utilization**: Team capacity and allocation efficiency
- **Quality Metrics**: Defect rates and rework requirements

**Metrics Calculation Functions:**
```typescript
interface MilestoneMetrics {
  completion_rate: number;        // On-time delivery percentage
  efficiency_ratio: number;       // Actual/estimated effort ratio
  velocity_trend: number[];       // Completion velocity over time
  blocker_impact: {
    average_resolution_days: number;
    cascading_delays: number;
    prevention_rate: number;
  };
  resource_metrics: {
    utilization_percentage: number;
    allocation_conflicts: number;
    cross_training_coverage: number;
  };
  quality_indicators: {
    rework_percentage: number;
    stakeholder_satisfaction: number;
    technical_debt_ratio: number;
  };
}
```

**Step 3: Cross-Milestone Dependency Analysis**

**Dependency Status Tracking:**
```yaml
dependency_matrix:
  milestone-013:
    depends_on: ["milestone-011", "milestone-012"]
    dependency_status: "satisfied"
    blocks: ["milestone-015"]
    blocker_risk: "low"
    
  milestone-014:
    depends_on: ["external-api-v2", "milestone-013"]
    dependency_status: "at_risk"  # external-api-v2 delayed
    blocks: ["milestone-015", "milestone-016"]
    blocker_risk: "high"
    impact_assessment: "cascading delay to 2 downstream milestones"
    
  milestone-015:
    depends_on: ["milestone-013", "milestone-014"]
    dependency_status: "waiting"
    blocks: ["milestone-016", "milestone-017"]
    blocker_risk: "medium"
    parallel_work_opportunities: ["documentation", "deployment-scripts"]
```

**Step 4: Session Context Synchronization**

**Context Update Protocol:**
- Load current session state from .milestones/sessions/ directory
- Validate context consistency across multiple active sessions
- Detect and resolve state conflicts between concurrent operations
- Update progress snapshots and session checkpoints
- Maintain cross-session milestone state continuity

**Session State Management:**
```yaml
session_sync:
  active_sessions:
    - session_id: "session-20240713-001"
      milestone_focus: "milestone-013"
      last_checkpoint: "2024-07-13T14:30:00Z"
      conflicts: []
      
  context_conflicts:
    - conflict_type: "progress_percentage_mismatch"
      milestone_id: "milestone-013"
      session_1_value: 45
      session_2_value: 50
      resolution: "use_latest_validated_checkpoint"
      
  sync_resolution:
    strategy: "last_writer_wins_with_validation"
    validation_required: true
    backup_checkpoints: true
```

**Step 5: Conflict Detection and Resolution Strategy**

**Multi-Agent Conflict Analysis:**
- Resource allocation conflicts across milestones
- Timeline conflicts and scheduling optimization
- Dependency conflicts and resolution paths
- Technical integration conflicts between milestone deliverables
- Stakeholder expectation conflicts and communication needs

**Conflict Resolution Framework:**
```yaml
conflict_resolution:
  resource_conflicts:
    detection: "agent-based resource utilization analysis"
    resolution: ["reallocation", "timeline-adjustment", "scope-negotiation"]
    
  timeline_conflicts:
    detection: "critical path analysis with buffer validation"
    resolution: ["parallel-workstreams", "dependency-acceleration", "scope-reduction"]
    
  technical_conflicts:
    detection: "integration point analysis and compatibility checking"
    resolution: ["architecture-adjustment", "interface-standardization", "integration-testing"]
```

**Step 6: Stakeholder Reporting and Communication**

**Report Generation Types:**
- **Executive Summary**: High-level progress and key decisions needed
- **Technical Status**: Detailed progress with technical blockers and solutions
- **Resource Reports**: Team utilization and capacity planning insights
- **Risk Assessment**: Current risks with mitigation strategies and timeline impact

**Communication Templates:**
```markdown

### üìã Next Week Priorities
1. Complete integration testing (M-013)
2. Resolve external API dependency (M-014)
3. Begin deployment preparation parallel workstream (M-015)
```

**Step 7: Actionable Insights and Recommendations Engine**

**Recommendation Categories:**
- **Immediate Actions**: Urgent issues requiring immediate attention
- **Optimization Opportunities**: Efficiency improvements and process optimization
- **Risk Mitigation**: Proactive measures to prevent future blockers
- **Strategic Adjustments**: Long-term planning and scope optimization

**Insights Generation Algorithm:**
```typescript
interface ActionableInsight {
  category: "immediate" | "optimization" | "risk_mitigation" | "strategic";
  priority: "critical" | "high" | "medium" | "low";
  title: string;
  description: string;
  impact_assessment: {
    timeline_impact_days: number;
    resource_impact: number;
    risk_reduction_percentage: number;
  };
  implementation_steps: string[];
  success_metrics: string[];
}
```

**Step 8: Multi-Agent Status Coordination**

**Agent Spawning Strategy for Comprehensive Analysis:**
```
"I'll coordinate multiple monitoring agents for complete status analysis:

Primary Status Agent: Overall milestone status aggregation and dashboard generation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Metrics Agent: Performance calculation and trend analysis
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dependency Agent: Cross-milestone relationship analysis and conflict detection
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Context Agent: Session state synchronization and conflict resolution
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Risk Agent: Proactive blocker detection and mitigation planning
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Reporting Agent: Stakeholder communication and insight generation

Each agent will contribute specialized analysis while maintaining consistency through shared state management and validation protocols."
```

**Agent Communication Protocol:**
- Real-time status data sharing between agents
- Conflict detection and escalation mechanisms
- Validation checkpoints for data consistency
- Coordinated insight generation and recommendation synthesis

**Step 9: Continuous Monitoring and Alert System**

**Real-Time Monitoring Capabilities:**
- Progress velocity tracking with trend analysis
- Blocker emergence detection and early warning systems
- Resource utilization monitoring with capacity alerts
- Dependency status monitoring with cascade impact analysis
- Quality metrics tracking with threshold alerting

**Alert Thresholds and Escalation:**
```yaml
monitoring_thresholds:
  progress_velocity:
    warning: "20% below target velocity for 2 consecutive days"
    critical: "30% below target velocity or milestone at risk"
    
  blocker_duration:
    warning: "blocker unresolved for 24 hours"
    critical: "blocker unresolved for 48 hours with cascade impact"
    
  resource_utilization:
    warning: "over 90% utilization across critical resources"
    critical: "resource conflicts causing milestone delays"
```
