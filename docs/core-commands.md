## üë®‚Äçüíª `/explain-like-senior` - Senior Developer Insights

### Overview
Provides **experienced developer explanations** focusing on the why behind code decisions, trade-offs, and architectural choices.

### Key Features
- **Technical and business context** analysis
- **Experience-driven insights**
- **Mentoring approach**
- **Code evolution perspective**

### Usage
```bash
claude explain-like-senior "auth/jwt-middleware.ts"
# Provides senior-level explanation
```

### Analysis Dimensions
- **Why this approach** over alternatives
- **Performance implications** and bottlenecks
- **Maintenance considerations** over time
- **Business impact** of technical decisions
- **Future evolution** possibilities

### Example Output
```markdown
## Senior Developer Perspective

### Why JWT Instead of Sessions?
This implementation chose JWT for stateless authentication because:
- Horizontal scaling without session store
- Reduced database load (no session lookups)
- Trade-off: Token size vs. database queries

### Performance Considerations
The middleware caches decoded tokens for 5 minutes:
- Prevents redundant JWT verification (expensive)
- Trade-off: Memory usage vs. CPU cycles
- At scale, consider Redis for shared cache

### Maintenance Warning
The refresh token rotation here will cause issues:
- Race conditions under high concurrency
- Consider implementing grace period
- Future: Move to sliding window approach
```

- **Comprehensive analysis** using native tools
- **Actionable recommendations** with priorities

### Usage

## üí° Best Practices

### Architecture First
Always use `/architect` before implementing complex features to ensure proper design and avoid costly refactoring.

### Milestone Tracking
Use `/milestone` for any feature taking more than a day to implement - the tracking overhead pays off in organization.

### Quality Gates
Run `/check` before every commit to maintain consistent code quality and prevent accumulation of technical debt.

### Pattern Consistency
Use `/scaffold` to maintain consistent patterns across the codebase rather than creating files manually.

### Regular Analysis
Run `/understand` and `/predict-issues` periodically to maintain awareness of codebase health and emerging problems.
